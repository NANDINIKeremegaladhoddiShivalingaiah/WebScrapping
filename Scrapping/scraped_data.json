            "Critiquing SEBI’s Narrow Interpretation of the Inter-Se Transfer Exemption By GuestSeptember 28, 20236 Min readAdd comment   [Simran Sharma is a fourth year B.A.,LL.B (Trade and Investment Law Hons.) student at National Law University, Jodhpur} The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) provided informal guidance in June this year on the interpretation of the “inter se transfer exemption” under the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 (“Takeover Code”). This post aims to comprehensively critique SEBI’s narrow interpretation of this exemption in a specific case. The author will begin by outlining the facts and the guidance sought from SEBI. Subsequently, it will analyse the inter-se transfer exemption and its operational framework under the Takeover Code. Finally, it will discuss the potential implications of SEBI’s narrow construction of the exemption. The case revolves around Vidli Restaurants Limited (“Target Company”) and its three promoters: Dr. Vidhi V. Kamat, Kamats Worldwide Food Services Private Limited (“KWFSPL”), and Vits Hotels Worldwide Private Limited (“VHWPL”). VHWPL held a majority shareholding in the Target Company. Dr. Vidhi Kamat intended to gift 9998 equity shares held by herself in Vits Hotels Worldwide Pvt. Ltd. to Dr. Vikram V. Kamat, her husband, i.e., to her “immediate relative”. This transaction would indirectly grant Dr. Vikram Kamat control over the Target Company, triggering a mandatory open offer requirement. According to the facts provided, Dr. Vikram V. Kamat currently does not hold any equity shares or voting rights (VRs) in the Target Company. As a result of this proposed transaction, Dr. Vikram Kamat’s shareholding in VITS Hotels Worldwide Pvt. Ltd. would increase to 99.99% of the equity shareholding. Consequently, he would indirectly acquire control over the Target Company, along with his wife, who already holds a 13.30% shareholding in the Target Company. This cumulative shareholding triggers a mandatory offer requirement. The key question for SEBI’s analysis is whether the proposed transaction is eligible for exemption under regulation 10(1)(a)(i) of the Takeover Code. This exemption would relieve the parties involved from the obligation to make an open offer as required by regulation 3 read with regulation 5 of the Takeover Code. In its informal guidance, SEBI has clarified that the proposed transaction in question does not meet the criteria for an inter-se transfer of shares within the Target Company. Rather, it involves the transfer of shares of the holding company, VHWPL. The guidance stated that inter-se transfer exemption provided under the Takeover Code does not apply to transfers of shares in the holding company. Therefore, the transaction is not eligible for the inter-se transfer exemption, and the parties involved are not exempt from the open offer obligations under the Takeover Code. SEBI has, however, indicated that the parties involved can submit an exemption application under regulation 11(1) of the Takeover Code to seek relief from the open offer requirements. Even while noting that Dr. Vikram is a member of the promoter group in the case at hand, a condition that itself operates as an “automatic exemption” as it is counted as an inter-se transfer,  the informal guidance clarified that the inter-se transfer exemption applies specifically to transfers of shares among “immediate relatives” of promoters within the target company. The implication is that in cases where control of the target company is indirectly acquired through the transfer of shares of the promoter entity in the holding company instead of the takeover company, the automatic exemption from making an open offer does not apply. The critique of SEBI’s interpretation of the inter-se transfer exemption is based on several key points indicating the scheme of the operation of this exemption. The author argues that SEBI’s narrow construction deviates from a broader understanding of the inter-se transfer exemption. The purpose of the exemption is to facilitate smoother transactions among qualified parties who have an existing relationship or alignment of interests. In this regard, a granular analysis of the framework of the Takeover Code is required. Regulation 3, read with regulation 5, specifies that even in cases of indirect acquisitions where the cumulative shareholding or voting rights exceed 25%, a public announcement of an open offer is required. However, regulation 10 provides automatic exemptions, including inter-se transfers, where an open offer is not mandatory. The author proposes that if direct and indirect acquisitions are treated at par with each other for the purposes of triggering an open offer, it should be treated no differently when it comes to assessing their eligibility for exemptions to this requirement under regulation 10. An inter-se transfer involves qualified parties such as immediate relatives, identified promoters, companies and their subsidiaries, persons acting in concert, and shareholders who have been persons acting in concert. These transfers may be exempted from the mandatory offer requirement due to their existing relationships or alignment of interests. The understanding of “persons acting in concert” under regulation 2(q) is relevant, as it also serves as an exemption to the mandatory offer requirement under a category in regulation 10. This concept ought to be examined in the context of the regulatory framework for exemptions to the open offer requirement. Parties pursuing a common objective or purpose to acquire shares, voting rights, or control over the target company are considered persons acting in concert. This includes companies under the same management or control as the acquiring entity. The author contends that acquisitions of shares or voting rights within the same group, where control of the target company remains unchanged, may not necessitate a mandatory open offer. SEBI’s narrow interpretation of the inter-se transfer exemption is critiqued for failing to consider the exemption’s purpose and the broader scope of qualifying parties. By limiting the exemption to “immediate relatives,” SEBI adds administrative burden and strays from a purposive interpretation of the Takeover Code. The author proposes modifying the exemption to specifically include transfers among shareholders of the holding company of the target company. SEBI’s narrow interpretation has the potential to increase administrative burden by imposing additional disclosure requirements, regulatory scrutiny, compliance costs, and uncertainty. This affects parties involved in transfers between shareholders of the holding company, especially smaller companies or individual shareholders with limited resources. A more inclusive interpretation of the inter-se transfer exemption would bring clarity, reduce administrative burden, and promote consistency. – Simran Sharma Informal Guidance Mergers and Acquisitions SEBI Takeover Regulations"

            "Capital Reduction: Tax Conundrums By GuestSeptember 23, 202310 Min readAdd comment   [Sumit Bansal (Partner), Shivani Chhabra (Associate) and Taranjeet Singh (Associate) are with S&R Associates, Advocates] Capital reduction refers to the technique of reducing a company’s share capital in any form. It is a mechanism usually adopted by companies for re-modelling their capital structure, amongst other means (viz., buy-back of shares and redemption of preference share capital). The need for reducing share capital may arise due to several reasons, such as returning excess funds to the shareholders, eliminating share capital not represented in the form of assets, adjustment of accumulated losses appearing in the books of accounts, minority exit, producing a more efficient capital structure, and the like. Section 66 of the Companies Act, 2013 governs the law for capital reduction, which provides that for a company to reduce its share capital it should possess the power under its articles of association (“AOA”) to do so by following the procedure laid down under such provisions. Unlike buy-back of shares provided under section 68 of the Companies Act, an application needs to be filed before the jurisdictional bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) by the company seeking such reduction in share capital and consent is required from the shareholders and creditors. Depending upon the objectives and attendant circumstances, a company can undertake a share capital reduction either with or without making any payment to its shareholders (to return their surplus capital). The following are the most likely modes by which a reduction in share capital is undertaken:  Reduction in the face value of all shares without cancelling the shares in toto; or Reduction in full of a selective number of shares leading to a cancellation of such shares.  Reduction in the Face Value of Shares In the Hands of the Shareholders Deemed dividend implications When a company returns cash to its shareholders by way of capital reduction, it amounts in essence to a distribution of profits to shareholders. In other words, the amount distributed to shareholders pursuant to a capital reduction is akin to dividend distribution and consequently attracts dividend taxation to the extent the company undertaking capital reduction possess accumulated profits (viz., accounting profits). Section 2(22) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provides for taxation of such distribution or payments which are in the nature of dividends, although not explicitly distributed in the form of dividend. Clause (d) of the said section deals with the taxation of amount distributed pursuant to capital reduction. It provides that any distribution by a company to its shareholders on the reduction of its capital to the extent of accumulated profits, whether capitalized or not, would be treated as deemed dividend. With effect from April 1, 2020, dividend distribution tax (“DDT”) was abolished in the hands of the company and dividend has become taxable in the hands of the shareholders. Therefore, such deemed dividend is taxable in the hands of the shareholders as ‘income from other sources’ and tax is levied at the rates applicable to such shareholders depending upon the category of the assessee (e.g., individual, domestic company, foreign company, etc.) Capital gains implications Capital gains tax implications shall arise only if the proceeds received upon capital reduction exceed the amount of accumulated profits. Shares of a company are typically held as a ‘capital asset’ referred to in section 2(14) of the Income Tax Act by the shareholders. By virtue of capital reduction, shares are cancelled and shareholders’ interest in a company gets extinguished. Therefore, this constitutes ‘transfer’ in the hands of shareholders within the meaning of section 2(47) of the said legislation. Although there is no specific provision in the Act dealing with taxability of consideration received by shareholders in excess of accumulated profits, Supreme Court held in Commissioner of Income Tax v. G. Narasimhan [1999] 236 ITR 327 that any distribution over and above the accumulated profits would be chargeable to capital gains tax in the hands of the shareholders. The amount chargeable to tax would be computed as under:     Particulars   Amount     Proceeds received on capital reduction by shareholder   (1)     Less: Amount treated as deemed dividend (to the extent of accumulated profits of the company): chargeable to tax   (2)     Consideration received for the purpose of capital gains   (3) = (1) – (2)     Less: Cost of acquisition for the shareholder   (4)     Capital Gains: chargeable to tax   (5) = (3) – (4)     There is no guidance under the Income Tax Act on determination of the cost of acquisition in case of a partial reduction in the face value of the shares. It is possible to take the view that cost proportionate to the face value of the share being reduced should be the cost of acquisition. Therefore, if the shareholder acquired the share having a face value of INR 10 for a purchase price of for INR 200, in case of 70% reduction in the face value of share, the cost of acquisition for the purpose of calculating capital gains shall be INR 140. However, in the absence of any specific provision, this could be challenged by the tax authorities. In case there is no distribution on capital reduction, a view can be taken that the proportionate cost of acquisition may be considered as ‘capital loss’ in the hands of shareholder. However, in this regard, Mumbai Tribunal (Special Bench) in Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd. [2011] ITR(T) 97 (Mumbai) has held that no transfer is involved in case of capital reduction: it is merely a substitution of one kind of shares with another kind of shares, and the loss arising on account of capital reduction is not an allowable capital loss. Note that this case dealt with reduction of the face value of shares without any payout to the shareholders. In the Hands of the Company Finally, note that no tax implications arise in the hands of the company for a reduction in the face value of shares it has issued. Reduction in the Number of Shares (Cancellation of Shares) While the underlying basic principles remain the same, capital reduction under this method involves extinguishment of the shares, like that undertaken in a buy-back procedure. Since there exists separate code for tax treatment of cancellation of shares, it has given rise to differing and contentious opinions. There is an argument that the proceeds from capital reduction undertaken pursuant to cancellation of shares would be liable to tax under section 115QA of the Income Tax Act, which contains “special provisions relating to tax on distributed income of domestic company for buy-back of shares”, as the capital reduction by way of cancellation of shares tantamount to the company purchasing its own shares. Section 115QA was inserted in the Income Tax Act by the Finance Act, 2013. This provision starts with a non obstanteclause and provides that the company (listed/unlisted) undertaking capital reduction is liable to pay tax at the rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on the amount of distributed income (hereinafter referred to as the ‘buy-back tax’). The term ‘distributed income’ means the consideration paid by the company on buy-back of shares as reduced by the amount which was received by the company for issue of such shares, determined according to the mechanism provided in the Income Tax Rules, 1962. Further, the explanation to section 115QA of the Income Tax Act defines the term ‘buy-back’ as a ‘purchase by a company of its own shares in accordance with the provisions of any law for the time being in force relating to companies.’ This is a revised definition which was amended by the Finance Act, 2016. Prior to this amendment, the term buy-back was defined to mean “purchase by a company of its own shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 77A of the Companies Act, 1956.” However, the Memorandum explaining the Finance Bill 2016 (‘Memorandum’) clarified that the provisions of this section shall apply to any buy-back undertaken by the company in accordance with the provisions of the law relating to the Companies and not necessarily restricted to section 77A of the Companies Act, 1956. Therefore, it is clear from the Memorandum that the amendment in section 115QA of the Income Tax Act was brought in to widen the scope of section 115QA so as to include in its ambit any purchase of its shares undertaken by a company under any provision of the Companies Act which has the effect of distribution of income by the company to its shareholders. In other words, what is relevant is the substance of a transaction involving distribution of income by the company to the shareholders and not the governing section/provision of the Companies Act under which such a transaction/arrangement is undertaken. The Memorandum bringing such amendment itself recognizes that it is possible for a company to undertake purchase of its own shares through means and mode other than buy-back mechanism prescribed under section 77A of the Companies Act, 1956 (or the corresponding section 68 of the Companies Act, 2013). Accordingly, the definition of term “buy-back” under section 115QA of the Act is no longer restricted to only cover a transaction of purchase of its own shares by the company under section 77A of the Companies Act, 1956 (or the corresponding section 68 of the Companies Act, 2013) but any transaction involving purchase of its own shares by the company in accordance with the provisions of Companies Act. In light of the above explanation, since the reduction of capital by way of cancellation of shares (which shall be undertaken under section 66 of the Companies Act, 2013) involves purchase of its own shares by the company from the shareholders (followed by subsequent cancellation and extinguishment of those shares since the company is not permitted to hold its own shares) and also carries an important element of distribution of income to the shareholders pursuant to reduction, such a transaction may get covered within the purview of section 115QA of the Income Tax Act after the aforesaid amendment. In the Hands of the Company Section 115QA of the Income Tax Act may become applicable and, accordingly, the company will be required to pay buy-back tax at the rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on the amount of distributed income (as discussed above). In the Hands of the Shareholders No tax implications should arise in the hands of the shareholders as section 10(34A) of the Income Tax Act provides a specific exemption if the shareholders receive any income on account of buy-back of shares by a company referred to in section 115QA of the Act. Way Forward Capital reduction has, over the years, proved to be an effective mechanism for alignment of capital to address corporate needs. Though the timeline may be a crucial aspect considering that it involves various approval requirements for undertaking a capital reduction (including approval of NCLT), it could have the potential to attain certain key business objectives such as repatriation of surplus cash, cleaning of the balance sheet by writing off accumulated losses, enabling exit to minority shareholders, and repaying whole or a part of the capital. Note that the capital reduction process can be carried out along with a scheme of merger/demerger or any compromise or arrangement as the procedure specified in a capital reduction is similar to the one specified for corporate re-arrangements as provided in section 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013. However, one needs to be mindful of the tax implications that could arise in the hands of the company undertaking such capital reduction and its shareholders under different situations. – Sumit Bansal, Shivani Chhabra & Taranjeet Singh Buyback Mergers and Acquisitions Taxation"

            "Tussle for Jurisdiction: CCI vs. The Controller General of Patents By GuestSeptember 23, 202310 Min readAdd comment   [Jishnudeep Kolay and Saumya Bapna are second-year B.A. LL.B (Hons.) students at the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru] In July 2023, the Delhi High Court in Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson v. Competition Commission of India (‘Ericsson II’) ruled that in an issue of abuse of dominance by a patentee in the exercise of their rights under the patent, the Patents Act, 1970 will prevail over the Competition Act, 2002. Therefore, it granted exclusive jurisdiction to the Controller General of Patents over the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”). Reversing its single-judge decision in 2016 (“Ericsson I”), the High Court held that it would be contrary to legislative intent to permit CCI to conduct inquiries in allegations of anti-competitive agreements concerning patents. Further, it posited that since the Patents Act provides for the powers to deal with such agreements and the fact that it is a special law in the field of patents, CCI cannot enjoy jurisdiction. This post critiques the Court’s judgement under two grounds. First, it shows that the Court erred in its interpretation of the legislative intention. Second, it demonstrates that the Court failed to appreciate the object of the Competition Act and the powers of the CCI to ensure fair competition in India. The Judgment The Delhi High Court extensively compared the relevant provisions in the two statutes. It reasoned that the powers of the CCI under sections 19(3) and 19(4) of the Competition Act, for investigating anti-competitive agreements, are not different from that of the Controller under sections 84(6) and (7) of the Patents Act. Section 84 of the Patents Act stipulates conditions for an application for granting compulsory licence on a patent. Section 84(6)(iv) requires the applicant to make efforts to procure the licence on reasonable terms. However, the proviso to this clause carves an exception to the above requirement, when the patentee adopts anti-competitive practices. Based on the comparison, the High Court posited that the Patents Act is a special statute in the field of patent rights. Therefore, even in anti-competitive issues related to patents, the Controller will have exclusive jurisdiction. Moreover, compulsory licenses under Chapter XVI were introduced by the 2003 amendment, after the enactment of the Competition Act. This was interpreted by the Court as conclusive legislative intent granting exclusivity of jurisdiction to the Controller. The same was reasoned to be confirmed by section 3(5)(i)(b) of the Competition Act. The section excludes ‘reasonable’ restrictions in agreements under rights granted by the Patents Act from the ambit of CCI’s investigations. Therefore, the Patents Act was held to prevail over the Competition Act in anti-competitive issues of patent licenses. The Court’s reasoning was two-fold: first, the inclusion of section 84(6)(iv) in the Patents Act after the enactment of the Competition Act shows legislative intention in favour of the former. Second, since the powers of both the CCI and the Controller are similar, the latter shall have exclusive jurisdiction. A scrutiny of the provisions coupled with an analysis of the legislative intent dispel both assertions. Legislative Intention: In Favour of Exclusivity? Section 84 of the Patents Act provides for the grant of compulsory licenses. Section 84(6)(iv) states that the licensee must make efforts to obtain such a license on reasonable terms, before applying for a compulsory one. The proviso carves out an exception when the patentee indulges in anti-competitive practices. On the other hand, section 3(5)(i)(b) of the Competition Act allows the imposition of ‘reasonable conditions’ restraining competition, to protect the rights granted under the Patents Act. Ericsson II posits that since CCI is barred from examining ‘reasonable conditions’ and the Controller can take into account anti-competitive practices, exclusive jurisdiction lies with the latter. Such a position is, with respect, flawed. The object of the proviso to section 84(6)(iv) is altogether different. While the provision requires a licensee to make efforts to obtain a license on valid terms, the proviso simply exempts such a requirement in case the patentee adopts anti-competitive practices. The same is not a substantive provision on preventing anti-competitive practices. On the other hand, section 3(5)(i)(b) of the Competition Act allows ‘reasonable conditions’ in agreements restraining Competition if such a condition is under a statutory right. Therefore, such clauses will not be regarded as anti-competitive. It is submitted that section 3(5)(i)(b) does not exclude the examination of such clauses by the CCI completely. The term ‘reasonable’ implies that the CCI will have to check for such reasonability. If it finds the term not to be reasonable, there is nothing to stop it from declaring it void under section 27 of the Act. Further, the object of introducing section 84 under Chapter XVI of the Patents Act was not to ensure fair competition as a comprehensive measure. The Joint Parliamentary Committee Report specifically stated that the primary object of the amendment to the said Chapter is to make patents relating to the health sector more conducive and affordable. The speech of the Commerce Minister, introducing the bill, also clarifies the same. Section 84 simply allows the Controller to grant compulsory licenses to prevent the abuse of patents that are in the public interest. Moreover, section 89 clarifies that the general purpose of compulsory licensing is to attain proper utilisation of patent rights. In this regard, section 83(b) of the Patents Act may also be considered. It states that patents are not merely to allow a monopoly to patentees. It can be argued that section 83(b) read with section 84 has been enacted to prevent anti-competitive practices. However, a few provisions targeting anti-competitive practices should not be equated to a comprehensive regime for guaranteeing fair competition. Furthermore, section 90(1)(ix) of the Patents Act uses the phrase “determined after judicial or administrative process to be anti-competitive”. This has been correctly interpreted by Ericsson I as the legislative intention of harmonising the Competition Act with Patent law. Ericsson II has not even considered the import of this section which directly goes against the exclusivity of the Patents Act. Therefore, the legislative intention is strictly not in favour of the Patent Act’s exclusivity. Schemes of the Respective Statutes Ericsson II analysed specific provisions of the two Acts and concluded that the Controller has similar powers as the CCI. Therefore, it can adjudicate on anti-competitive disputes concerning patents. This led to the conclusion that CCI would not have jurisdiction. The preceding section has shown that the legislative intention was never to exclude the jurisdiction of CCI. This section will show how Ericsson II failed to appreciate the expansive powers of the CCI over the Controller in ensuring effective competition. Certain provisions of the Patents Act do deal with the anti-competitiveness of Patents. Section 84, as discussed above, is one of them. Section 90(1)(ix) allows that licensee to export the product if such a license is granted to remedy a practice determined to be anti-competitive. Further, section 140 prohibits any license agreement from having anti-competitive terms. On a prima facie basis, it may seem that the Act does give the Controller wide powers to deal with anti-competitive practices concerning patents. However, such powers are limited. First, the powers of the Controller are in personem and not in rem unlike that of the CCI. Therefore, they are related to the specific patent or license. Second,checking for anti-competitive clauses in particular patents or licenses cannot be equated with prohibiting adverse effects on competition as a whole. While the Controller’s authority is limited to the former, the CCI’s role covers the latter. For example, CCI might be better equipped to keep a check on patent cartels and monopolistic combinations than the Controller. Sections 3 and 4 of the Competition Act not only deal with simple anti-competitive agreements but also with cartels, combinations and other kinds of restrictive practices. Further, section 19(3)(f) of the Competition Act requires the CCI to consider the promotion of market innovative practices in determining the anti-competitive effects of an agreement. Consequently, CCI’s regulation of anti-competitive practices promotes market innovation in the long run. Therefore, the CCI has wider powers and can better check such practices even in the field of patents. The above contention finds support in the Ayyangar Committee Report as well. The committee suggested that restrictive practices in patents cannot be dealt with by simply amending the Patent Act, but requires more comprehensive tools to deal with the various types of restrictive combinations. Similar is the view taken by the Raghavan Committee. It has emphasised the distinction between the “existence of a right and its exercise”. It recommended that anti-competitive practices in the exercise of such a right “ought to be” checked under the Competition regime. Further, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) Report on ‘Competition Policy and Intellectual Property Rights’ also highlights the benefits of applying competition policy on licensing of intellectual property. In CCI v Bharti Airtel (“Airtel”), the Supreme Court had to deal with a similar tussle of jurisdiction between Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (“TRAI”) and the CCI. It mentioned that the CCI has a distinct object to ensure fair competition. It went on to posit that CCI is better equipped to find whether an agreement can have adverse effects on competition. It held that TRAI cannot have exclusive jurisdiction, because even if TRAI finds the agreement anti-competitive, it cannot transcend the TRAI Act. On the other hand, CCI exclusively deals with these agreements, therefore a better choice. Ironically, this case was heavily relied upon by the Court in Ericsson II. Here, the court has clearly failed to recognise distinct mandates of the statutory bodies. Moreover, in Airtel, the Court had granted CCI a follow-on jurisdiction. It granted TRAI the original jurisdiction and CCI could investigate only after TRAI had concluded its inquiry. Interestingly, no such possibility was even considered by the Court in Ericsson II. In Ashoka Marketing v. Punjab National Bank, the Supreme Court held the policy and schemes of the acts as a factor in determining if there exists a ‘conflict’ between two statutes. At the outset, the larger objectives of the two statutes may seem to be in opposition to each other. However, substantive scrutiny of the provisions, as conducted above points to the contrary. This shows that the scheme of the Competition Act is not in ‘conflict’ with the wider aim of the Patents Act. Therefore, the Court’s reasoning in Ericsson II is based on an erroneous presumption of “conflict” between the two statutes. An approach akin to this, by creating a hierarchy between the statutes, ignores the material distinctions between their substantive provisions. If the reasoning in Ericsson II is accepted, then combination anti-competitive arrangements in patents may remain unchecked. Therefore, this post has shown that granting exclusive jurisdiction to the Controller was first, not the correct interpretation of legislative intent; and second, ignores the wide-ranging power vested with the CCI. The decision in Ericsson II calls for definite principles to demarcate the contours of the two regimes. Harmonising the two is not unheard of. Section 21 of the Competition Act allows other statutory authorities to refer a matter to the CCI. It has been argued that such a provision shows the intent to harmonise the Patents Act and the Competition regime.  It remains to be seen how long the Ericsson II continues to hold ground. It would do well for trade if the Supreme Court settles this contentious issue through a well-reasoned judgment. – Jishnudeep Kolay & Saumya Bapna Competition Act Competition Law Intellectual Property Regulation"

            "Supreme Court’s Caution against an Infinite Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process By GuestSeptember 22, 20236 Min readAdd comment   [Praveen Sharma is a 5th Year Student at MNLU Mumbai] Earlier this month, in RPS Infrastructure Ltd. v. Mukul Kumar (2023INSC816), the Supreme Court addressed a crucial issue concerning the timing of claims in the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). The Court was deciding on the question of whether a claim relating to an arbitral award, undergoing an appeal process under section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (Arbitration Act), could be accepted subsequent to the committee of creditors (COC) granting its approval to the resolution plan. The Supreme Court held that admitting claims after the COC has already accepted a resolution plan, even though the adjudicating authority has yet to approve the plan, would make the CIRP an endless process. This post analyses this judgment, offering insights into how it represents a crucial stride towards preventing an interminable CIRP and upholding the fundamental principle of time as an essence of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC). Background of the Case Over an issue on misconduct in advertising between RPS Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd and KST Infrastructure Private Limited, RPS had sought reference to arbitration. On 2 May 2011, an arbitration award was passed in the favor of RPS. Aggrieved by the award, KST filed a petition under section 34 of the Arbitration Act. In the meantime, CIRP was initiated against KST Infrastructure, i.e., the corporate debtor, in respect of its three real estate projects. An application under section 7 of the IBC was admitted by the adjudicating authority on 27 March 2019. Following this, on 11 July 2020, the resolution plan submitted by KST Whispering Heights Residential Welfare Association was approved by the COC by a majority vote of 80.74%. On 19 August 2020, RPS had made a notification about its pending claim arising from the arbitral award against KST Infrastructure. However, the interim resolution professional (IRP) declined the claim, citing that the submission deadline was set at 90 days from the commencement of the CIRP, and the applicant had exceeded this timeframe by 287 days, with the COC having already approved the resolution plan. RPS filed an application before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking consideration of its plan on merits. The NCLT granted the RPS relief on 3 November 2020. The decision was based on three key reasons: firstly, the claim should have been in the corporate debtor’s records; secondly, if those records were unavailable, KST was obliged to obtain and verify them; and finally, since the claim was announced in public newspapers, RPS might not have been aware of it. Subsequently, the IRP filed an appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) challenging the NCLT’s order. The NCLAT overturned the decision and held that IRP had adhered to regulation 6 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations 2016 and emphasised that RPS had ample opportunity within the mandated timeframe to submit its claim. The NCLAT observed that acceptance of new claims at this stage could potentially jeopardise the resolution plan that had already received the COC’s approval. Observations of the Supreme Court The Supreme Court affirmed the NCLAT’s stance that the IRP had followed the due process for determining the liabilities of the corporate debtor, KST. The Court placed the onus on RPS for failing to recognize the ongoing CIRP and admonished that admitting claims following the COC approval could prolong the CIRP indefinitely. Significance of the Judgement The Court in this judgement has unequivocally emphasised the crucial principle that the IBC is inherently a ‘time-bound process’. RPS’s contention based State Tax Officer v. Rainbow Papers Ltd. was that there should be a provision within the resolution plan to account for contingent claims. Going by this perspective, if the appeal is ultimately dismissed, and the award is finalised, any claim made by RPS not covered under the contingent claim provision would lose its standing. Nevertheless, it is imperative to recognise that the incorporation of arrangements for contingent claims was unnecessary in this instance, given that the resolution plan had been meticulously crafted based on the information memorandum. Therefore, the Supreme Court’s reliance on the Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel India Limited through Authorised Signatory v. Satish Kumar Gupta, which cautioned against admitting claims subsequent to the COC approving the resolution plan, conforms to the statutory intent of the IBC. It is crucial to emphasize that the Supreme Court did not immediately adopt the stance that claims submitted after approval by the COC ‘must not’ be entertained. Instead, it acknowledged the possibility of extending the timeframe under specific circumstances. The Court emphasised that such extensions should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, contingent upon the individual merits of each case. In the present context, the Supreme Court aptly deemed the 287-day delay in filing the claim in the present case as significant delay. Furthermore, the Court judiciously employed the term ‘vigilant’ in asserting that RPS should have exercised vigilance in recognising KST’s insolvency proceedings. This rationale stems from the expectation that RPS should have been aware of KST’s involvement in the CIRP and subsequently should have initiated their claim. The overarching concern is that allowing claims following a resolution plan’s approval could potentially open the door for unfounded claims to disrupt the process. It is worth emphasising that while the COC had approved the plan, it was still pending approval from the adjudicating authority. The Supreme Court adopted the position that the fact that the plan was pending approval of the adjudicating authority should not result in a perpetual oscillation, which would effectively transform the CIRP into an unending ordeal. Implicitly, this underscores the Court’s continued respect for the commercial judgment exercised by the COC, upholding the significance of the COC’s approval in the CIRP Process. Conclusion In a resounding verdict, the Supreme Court has taken a decisive stride towards upholding the time-bound nature of the IBC. In doing so, it has reaffirmed the significance of procedural diligence and the vital role of the IRP. The Court rightly observed that the IRP had meticulously followed the due process in claim collection, thereby placing a critical onus on claimants like RPS Infrastructure to exercise vigilance in their submissions. The glaring delay of 287 days in this case serves as a stark reminder of the potential pitfalls of admitting claims after the approval of the COC, which could indeed open the floodgates to an infinite array of claims, plunging the CIRP into an unending abyss. This judgment represents a pivotal milestone in ensuring the seamless and time-bound execution of the CIRP. It sends a strong signal to corporations and individuals to remain vigilant regarding the ongoing CIRP involving their stakeholders. As a result, this ruling stands as a formidable bulwark against the looming spectre of infinite CIRP. – Praveen Sharma Insolvency"

            "Establishing Performance Validation Agency: Examining SEBI’s Consultation Paper By GuestSeptember 21, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Daksh Kasliwal and Prakhar Singh are 3rd year BSW LL.B. (Hons.) students at Gujarat National University, Gandhinagar] Recently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has taken multiple steps to enhance the regulatory landscape to foster a more reliable and secure market environment for investors and entrepreneurs. Weeks after releasing a consultation paper to control unregistered finfluencers, SEBI on 31 August 2023 released a consultation paper to establish a Performance Validation Agency (PVA). The primary objectives of the PVA are to facilitate SEBI-registered intermediaries in disclosing their performance to investors for credibility enhancement and growth, while safeguarding investors’ interests against unverified claims. This post assesses SEBI’s proposal to establish a PVA, and its possible impact on the Indian financial market. What is a PVA? A PVA is proposed to be established as an independent body to validate claims and performance related to investment advice, buy/sell/hold recommendations, algorithms, and more, as offered by intermediaries and other similar entities like investment advisors (IA), research analysts (RA), and portfolio managers. While SEBI is yet to provide the complete eligibility criteria for PVA, it is proposed to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of market infrastructure institutions (MII) or multiple MIIs. This choice is motivated by the expected need for PVA to handle vast amounts of data, for which MIIs possess the requisite expertise. PVA’s Validation Spectrum: What Lies in its Mandate? The consultation paper sets out an inclusive list of claims and suggestions that the PVA can verify. It would be entrusted with the task of verifying:  The actual profits earned by clients of intermediaries based on the services provided. Such validation is to be carried out for all clients of an intermediary, and no cherry-picking of clients is permitted. Performance claims of intermediaries and other entities, along with claims regarding the performance of their algorithm. These algorithms are to be tested during a prospective reasonable test period. Performance of recommended stock/portfolio. For this, the concerned intermediary shall provide the PVA with the details of actual recommendations given to their clients.  Further, the PVA may verify any other claim, provided it does not involve cherry-picking favourable events or strategies. Furthermore, all such claims must be verified from independent sources other than the entity making the claim. This validation of performance or claim by the PVA will be based on specific parameters like return, risk, and volatility, which are to be determined by the industry forum in consultation with the PVA and SEBI. To determine this criterion, the PVA will be free to collaborate with other knowledge partners, such as credit rating agencies. However, the paper makes it a mandate for the PVA to maintain confidentiality throughout the process. Notably, the PVA can charge a reasonable fee for its validation services. Showcasing Validations: Transparency through Digital Avenues Upon completion of validation by the PVA, the validated information must be displayed on the entity’s website and/or the PVA’s website, depending on the nature of the claim or performance being verified. For instance, the entity should display performance validation for client-specific recommendations on its website, with restricted access only to the client to which that information pertains. In contrast, validations for publicly made recommendations must be displayed on the same day on both PVA’s and the intermediary’s websites. This display should be in a format as may be prescribed by the industry forum in consultation with the PVA and SEBI. Similarly, the performance of all the algorithms shared with the PVA for validation shall be disclosed and displayed on the website of the PVA. The Rationale Behind PVA SEBI’s proposal to establish the PVA stems from a twofold need. First, there exists a lacuna for verifying the investment-related claims made by entities, as there is no standardised mechanism. For instance, although the SEBI circular already requires that IA/RA refrain from making false or exaggerated claims, investors lack the means to verify the accuracy of these claims independently. This led to an increased number of entities making exaggerated claims regarding their recommendations to attract investors. It is pertinent to note that verification from a single brokerage firm can mislead investors since they do not provide a complete picture of a person’s trading performance across all accounts. Second, there has been consistent demand from some entities like IAs and RAs, who are not permitted to make reference to their past performances while giving advice. Similarly, stock brokers, too, cannot refer to past performance or expected future performance of the algorithm. There has been consistent demand to allow them to showcase their performance to increase their business. To address these challenges, there is a need for an independent and impartial body like the PVA to undertake impartial verification of investment-related claims made by entities. PVA’s Role in Transforming Investment Culture: Prospects and Concerns The proposal to establish the PVA is a commendable initiative. Past performance is a crucial factor for investors when making investment decisions, and there is substantial reliance on historical data when selecting investment avenues. The establishment of the PVA will introduce uniform criteria for claim verification, potentially shifting the paradigm from self-declaratory practices (which can be misleading) to a more rigorous validation approach. This initiative benefits both investors and intermediaries. Intermediaries with truthful and accurate claims will receive validation from the PVA, enhancing their credibility. Simultaneously, investors will be protected from unverified and potentially misleading claims from other intermediaries and entities. One noteworthy aspect of the proposal is that though the PVA possess the power to validate the claims, it does not have the discretion to select the claims or performances to be verified to benefit a particular stock or person. For instance, validation of actual profits is to be made for all the investors of a specific intermediary or entity, and no cherry-picking is permitted. If only the gain of a particular investor is verified, then such a report will be accessible only to that investor. The PVA’s validation standards may be more challenging to meet for smaller intermediaries and companies as the majority of them have limited financial resources and operational capacity compared to larger counterparts. Compliance with the validation standards would not only be limited to the payment of fee but would also require data gathering and reporting, which could lead to an unequal playing field. Furthermore, smaller participants might face trouble raising the necessary funds to comply with the PVA’s rules. Investors and lenders can be reluctant to fund or make investments in companies under more stringent regulatory scrutiny. According to the proposal, the PVA should verify claims using criteria including returns, risk, volatility, and other appropriate measures. However, the validation process may result in delays in reporting and informing investors. Investors could not have access to the most recent information while making investment decisions if the PVA takes an extended period to evaluate allegations. The proposal suggests that the PVA would process intermediaries’ data and claims or performance, including the privacy of customer data on strategies. This raises concerns about how the agency would handle sensitive information and ensure data privacy and security, as the data is very sensitive in nature, data breaches or leaks could have significant consequences. Lastly, as the PVA would be a SEBI-recognised entity, investors may cultivate an unwarranted sense of assurance by placing exclusive reliance on claims that have undergone PVA validation. It is imperative to emphasize that historical performance, albeit a significant metric, is not an unequivocal determinant of future outcomes in the realm of investment. Instead, prudent investment decisions necessitate a comprehensive consideration of multiple variables beyond historical performance data. Conclusion SEBI’s proposal to establish the PVA is a commendable step toward enhancing transparency and credibility in India’s financial markets. This initiative aims to provide investors with verified performance data, fostering a more informed investment culture. While there are concerns, such as potential challenges for smaller players and data privacy issues, these can be addressed through tailored regulations and robust security measures. The prospects offered by the PVA are promising. It can introduce standardised validation processes, shifting the focus from self-declared claims to accountable and verified performance data. Investors will benefit from reliable information, and credible intermediaries will gain recognition. To succeed, the PVA must strike a balance between transparency and the need to prevent overburdening market participants. Collaboration, innovation in validation methods, and data protection measures are essential. Ultimately, this initiative requires collective efforts from stakeholders to build trust in the financial ecosystem, benefiting investors and the market. – Daksh Kasliwal & Prakhar Singh SEBI Securities Regulation"

        "read_on_content": [
            "Navigating the Data Integration Conundrum: A Closer Look at IBC By GuestSeptember 19, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Aayushi Choudhary and Vaibhav Gupta are fourth year students of Gujarat National Law University, Gandhinagar] The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) brought about a major change in the landscape of corporate insolvency proceedings in the country. Nevertheless, despite the IBC’s transformative potential, its effective implementation has been hampered by a significant challenge: the dispersed and fragmented structure of data on insolvency cases. Currently, data is scattered among a number of platforms, each of which performs a different function. The web portal of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs stores financial data and compliance records; the web portal of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) administers case status and online orders; and the webportal of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) serves as a regulator’s data repository. Procedures are handled individually in respect of each of the bodies, and for debt and creditor information, IPA/Valuer Portals and National E-Governance Services Limited (NeSL) are used. Although each of these platforms has a special function, they are not integrated, which causes inefficiencies and delays in the insolvency process. The insolvency procedure is currently experiencing inefficiencies and delays due to a lack of platform interoperability. In this post, the authors have delved into the importance of consolidating IBC-related data into a single, unified platform and explored the potential benefits of such a move. Information Utilities: Accelerating Insolvency Resolution with Data Integrity In the insolvency of Go Airlines, the Information Utility (IU) system demonstrated its remarkable efficiency. The IBBI effortlessly transferred case-related information to the NeSL via an API before the NCLT officially acknowledged the start of the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). All of the corporate debtor’s bankers subsequently received emails alerting them to the imminent insolvency procedure. This demonstrates the crucial role IUs play in expediting the CIRP. The CIRP, which is governed by section 12 of the IBC, has a strict deadline of 330 days for completion that places an emphasis on efficiency. The ambitious CIRP timeline is based on the idea that all participants will have easy access to data pertinent to the process. The idea of IUs as envisioned by the IBC serves as the foundation for this confidence. IUs must be prepared to deliver all relevant information promptly in order to adhere to the rigid IBC timeframe. To fulfill these deadlines, it is imperative that all parties, including creditors, adjudicating authorities, and insolvency resolution professionals, have quick access to pertinent information. IUs play a crucial role in speeding the CIRP timeline by acting as an essential repository of verified data about debt and defaults. IUs also support insolvency professionals throughout the CIRP. All financial creditors are required by the IBC to provide the IU with information. In 2017, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued directives to banks, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), and asset reconstruction firms (ARCs) to ensure legal compliance. As a result, the IU keeps almost all of the information provided by corporate entities and creditors. Insolvency professionals can access the IU to examine the information with claims submitted by creditors after the general announcement, streamlining the claims verification procedure. An important step in accelerating the process of authenticating and verifying data regarding debtor default in insolvency cases was taken by the IBBI circular dated September 7, 2019. In order to expedite the debtor default verification procedure, it has reinforced the function of IUs by enabling them to retrieve the data from the Central Registry of Securitization Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest (CERSAI) portal. For the objective of registering security interests created on movable and intangible assets, such as accounts receivable, book debts, and hypothecation, as well as to begin registering all other kinds of mortgages used in India, CERSAI is a central online security interest registry established under the provisions of Chapter IV of the SARFAESI Act. Advancing IBC Through Data Integration The present system suffers from data duplication, disparate structures, and limited processability. To overcome these challenges, integrating data across various systems into a comprehensive IT framework for IBC processes is essential. Such integration offers numerous advantages, including a single source of truth throughout the insolvency process, real-time dashboards for data-driven decision-making, prioritization of security and privacy by design, maintenance of audit trails for transparency, and efficiency gains through streamlined data management. To address these challenges, it is imperative to streamline and centralize the data. Leveraging the MCA-21 database, a vital resource, can aid in the early identification of companies at risk of insolvency. The MCA launched an e-government programme called MCA21 which allows business organizations, employees, and Indian residents to easily and securely access MCA services. It provides essential data points, such as financial ratios, operational indicators, audit qualifications, and compliance issues, which are invaluable for proactively detecting companies in financial distress. Additionally, the MCA21 database can help identify sectors and industries prone to financial stress, using factors like insolvency numbers, debt levels, resolution times, and recovery rates, enabling policymakers to formulate sector-specific interventions. The CARO (Company’s Auditor Report Order) report, prepared by auditors, can provide insightful inputs for policy making. It assesses a company’s ability to continue as a going concern, the quality of internal controls and financial reporting, and compliance status, all of which guide policymakers in addressing financial stress. Data from NCLT and IBBI can be used to review IBC process outcomes, identify bottlenecks, analyze delays, and address stakeholder-specific issues. Moreover, examining post-insolvency resolution data, including production, revenue, bank financing, capital investments, and credit appraisal insights, aids in evaluating the effectiveness of the insolvency process and contributes to orderly credit growth in the economy. Recommendations A data-driven approach is fundamental for shaping effective insolvency law and enacting meaningful reforms within the insolvency landscape. To combat the existing challenge of scattered information sources across the IBC framework, a unified platform is imperative. This platform should be designed as a comprehensive IT framework for all IBC processes, providing seamless access to critical data. Data accessibility, analysis, and security can all be improved by utilizing cutting-edge technology such as blockchain, AI, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things. In addition to technological advancements, state-level investments in data collection systems are crucial. States can establish these systems by building upon existing infrastructure, creating a sophisticated mechanism for collecting insolvency-related data. A pivotal initial step in this process involves assessing the wealth of information sources already available, including general insolvency statistics, judicial data, and statistics provided by insolvency regulators and other relevant authorities. For instance, the MCA21 database presents a valuable resource for policymakers. This database can be harnessed to establish early warning systems based on various financial indicators, operational metrics, audit qualifications, and compliance records. These proactive systems enable the identification of companies at risk of insolvency well in advance. Additionally, by utilizing MCA21 data, policymakers can identify specific sectors and industries that are susceptible to financial stress, facilitating the formulation of tailored policy interventions. These interventions can address critical factors like insolvency rates, debt burdens, resolution timelines, and recovery rates. Furthermore, the foundation of sound insolvency policies relies on the collection and thorough analysis of empirical data. This approach ensures that legislative changes are precisely tailored to resolve particular problems within the insolvency framework. Regular compilation and analysis of data offer valuable insights that inform the design of reforms and gauge their effectiveness. This iterative process creates a feedback loop, reinforcing the impact of legislative interventions. In an era characterized by the prominence of big data, policymaking in the absence of empirical data must be avoided to prevent inefficiencies and potential adverse consequences. Conclusion  The role of information as a crucial utility in CIRP cannot be overstated. The expeditious resolution of insolvency cases, particularly within the mandated 330-day timeline, is heavily reliant on the availability and accessibility of comprehensive information. When all relevant data and documents are conveniently aggregated in one central repository, it empowers resolution professionals with the essential tools needed to navigate complex insolvency proceedings efficiently. The centralized information hub will serve as a vital resource, providing resolution professionals with a holistic view of the distressed entity’s financial history, assets, liabilities, contracts, and operational intricacies. Such a comprehensive repository not only streamlines decision-making but also significantly reduces the time and effort required to gather scattered information from various sources. Armed with a comprehensive information pool, they can make informed decisions promptly, engage stakeholders more efficiently, and ultimately expedite the resolution process. This, in turn, aligns with the overarching goal of the insolvency framework – to maximize value for creditors and stakeholders while ensuring timely closure of insolvency cases. In conclusion, consolidating and integrating IBC-related data into a unified platform is not merely a technological upgrade; it is a critical step towards ensuring the IBC’s success in promoting economic stability and growth in India. This move will streamline the insolvency process, facilitate policy interventions, and enable efficient decision-making, ultimately benefiting all stakeholders in the insolvency ecosystem. – Aayushi Choudhary & Vaibhav Gupta Data Information Technology Insolvency"

            "Analysing the Tax Implications of Bonus Shares By GuestSeptember 19, 20237 Min readAdd comment   [Arjim Jain is a 3rd year B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student at National Law University, Odisha] The ruling in DCIT v. Smt Aruna Chandok rendered on 5 September 2023 by the Delhi Bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”) has shed light on a crucial aspect of taxation in India – the treatment of bonus shares under the Income Tax Act (“IT Act”). In this landmark decision, the ITAT has unequivocally stated that income tax is not chargeable on bonus shares under the heading “income from other sources.” This ruling has far-reaching implications for individual shareholders and investors in India, as it clarifies the taxation status of bonus shares and underscores the principles of fairness and equity in taxation. This post delves into the analysis of bonus shares, the ITAT’s ruling, and its implications. Analysing Bonus Shares Before delving into the intricacies of the ITAT’s ruling, it would be useful to analyse what bonus shares are and why they hold a special place in the corporate world. Bonus shares, also known as “scrip dividends or capitalization issues,” are additional fully paid up shares that a company issues to its existing shareholders without any cost. These shares are allocated to the shareholders in proportion to their current shareholdings. Bonus shares are typically issued out of the company’s retained earnings or free reserves and do not involve any cash outflow from the company. Instead, they represent a capitalization of profits and are a means for the company to reward its loyal shareholders. The key aspect of bonus shares is that they do not result in any immediate financial gain for the shareholders. While their shareholding in the company increases, the overall wealth of the shareholders remains the same, as the market price of each share adjusts accordingly after the bonus issue. This is a fundamental principle of bonus shares – they are a reshuffling of a shareholder’s existing rights in the company’s wealth, and not an inflow of fresh funds or income. The ITAT’s Ruling  In DCIT v. Smt. Aruna Chandok, an individual assessee had received bonus shares and bonus units from Tech Mahindra Ltd. and JM Arbitrage Advantage Fund-Bonus Options. The Assessing Officer (“AO”) sought to tax these bonus shares and units under section 56(2)(vii)(c) of the IT Act, claiming that the assessee had received a double benefit from them. However, the ITAT, in its wisdom, rejected the AO’s contention and upheld the principle that bonus shares do not constitute income for the recipient. The ITAT made several important observations in its ruling:  Capitalization of Profits: The tribunal emphasized that bonus shares are issued solely out of the capitalization of existing reserves in the company. They do not involve any inflow of fresh funds or income to the shareholders. Therefore, treating them as taxable income is incorrect. Maintaining Shareholder Wealth: The ITAT pointed out that the overall wealth of a shareholder, both pre-bonus and post-bonus, remains unchanged. The market price of each share adjusts after the bonus issue, ensuring that the value of the shareholder’s holding remains the same. Hence, there is no additional benefit or income received by the shareholder due to bonus shares. Proportionate Split: Bonus shares are distributed to all shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. This means that there is no transfer of property or receipt of any new asset by the shareholder. What the shareholder receives is a division of their own holdings. Misconception of Double Benefit: The tribunal criticized the AO’s assumption that bonus shares result in double benefits for the shareholder. It highlighted that the timing of selling shares is at the discretion of the shareholder, and there is no legal compulsion to sell immediately after receiving bonus shares. Therefore, the AO’s argument lacked merit.  The ITAT cited the Supreme Court’s decision in CIT v. General Insurance Corporation Ltd., which held that the issuance of bonus shares does not result in an inflow of fresh funds to the shareholders. It also noted that the market price of shares adjusts almost proportionally to the bonus issue, further confirming the absence of any additional benefit. Section 55(2)(aa)(i) and Capital Gains  Another important aspect of the ITAT’s ruling is its interpretation of section 55(2)(aa)(i) of the IT Act, which deals with the cost of acquisition of bonus shares. The CIT(A) had pointed out that the AO erred in concluding that this provision does not apply when “determining the cost of acquisition of bonus shares.” Section 55(2)(aa)(i) states that the cost of acquisition of bonus shares is nil. This provision recognizes the fact that bonus shares are essentially a capitalization of profits and, therefore, should not be considered as having a cost. The ITAT concurred with this interpretation and rejected the AO’s stance that section 55(2)(aa)(i) does not apply in the case of bonus shares. The ITAT’s reliance on the decision of the Karnataka High Court in Principal Commissioner of Income Tax v. Dr. Ranjan Pai further solidifies the principle that bonus shares do not result in an inflow of funds to shareholders and, therefore, should not be taxed under section 56(2)(v)(c). Taxation of Bonus Shares  To understand the implications of the ITAT’s ruling fully, it is essential to consider how bonus shares are taxed in India. Bonus shares can be subject to taxation in two distinct ways:  Capital Gains Tax: If an individual holds bonus shares as an investment and subsequently sells them, any profit generated from the sale may be subject to capital gains tax under sections 45 and 48 of the IT Act. The specific tax rate depends on whether the shares are classified as short-term or long-term capital assets. Business Income Tax: If an individual’s primary business involves trading in shares and securities, the sale of bonus shares may be considered business income. In this case, the profits are taxed under the provisions of section 28 of the IT Act.  The crucial point to note is that the taxation of bonus shares depends on the intent and nature of the holding. If the shareholder treats bonus shares as investments and holds them for the long term, capital gains tax is applicable. On the other hand, if the shareholder is engaged in the business of trading in shares, the profits may be treated as business income. The ITAT’s ruling primarily addresses the misconception that bonus shares should be taxed as income from other sources under Section 56(2)(ii)(c) of the IT Act. It clarifies that bonus shares are not income and should not be subject to taxation under this section. Conclusion The recent ruling by the Delhi Bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal is a significant development in the realm of taxation in India. It provides much-needed clarity on the treatment of bonus shares under the Income Tax Act, emphasizing that they do not constitute income for the recipient. Instead, bonus shares represent a capitalization of profits and a reshuffling of existing rights in the company’s wealth. This ruling is not only consistent with established legal principles but it also upholds the principles of fairness and equity in taxation. It ensures that individuals who receive bonus shares are not unduly burdened with additional tax liabilities for a transaction that does not result in any immediate financial gain. As investors and shareholders navigate the complexities of the tax landscape in India, they can take solace in the fact that bonus shares are not subject to income tax under the head “income from other sources”. This clarity not only benefits individual taxpayers but also promotes a more transparent and equitable taxation system in the country. – Arjim Jain Taxation"

        "title": "A Bank’s Post-Merger Liability for Pre-Merger Crimes",
        "read_on_content": [
            "A Bank’s Post-Merger Liability for Pre-Merger Crimes By Umakanth VarottilSeptember 17, 20236 Min readAdd comment   Earlier this month, the Supreme Court in Religare Finvest Limited v. State of NCT of Delhi (2023INSC819) considered the question whether the transferee bank in a merger can be fastened with corporate criminal liability for offences committed by the officials of the transferor bank prior to a merger of the two entities. The Court answered in the negative given the specific facts and circumstances of the case. Background and Decision Religare Finvest Limited (RFL) had filed a commercial suit against the erstwhile Laxmi Vilas Bank (LVB) for recovery of a sum of INR 791 crores. Subsequently, in September 2018, RFL also filed a criminal complaint alleging that certain officials of LVB conspired with two companies, RHC Holding Pvt. Ltd and Ranchem Pvt. Ltd, to misappropriate fixed deposits that were furnished by RFL with LVB. Although a chargesheet was filed against some officers of LVB, the banking company itself was not implicated as an accused. In November 2020, due to the unstable financial condition of LVB, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a moratorium on the bank under section 45(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and subsequently effected a compulsory amalgamation of LVB with DBS Bank India Limited under the same legislation. The business of the erstwhile LVB was taken over by DBS under the amalgamation, following which LVB ceased to exist as a legal entity. Thereafter, in February 2021, a supplementary charge sheet was filed to implicate DBS in the criminal proceedings along with the erstwhile officials of LVB as well as RHC Holding and Ranchem. Aggrieved by this, DBS filed a petition before the Delhi High Court seeking to quash the supplementary charge sheet against it. Since the Delhi High Court refused to oblige its request, DBS filed an appeal before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court analyzed the provisions of the scheme of amalgamation. Clause 3(3) provided that any proceedings pending against LVB “shall not abate, be discontinued or be ill [sic] any way prejudicially affected, but shall … be prosecuted and enforced by or against” DBS. However, more significantly, the clause contained a proviso which clarified that any criminal proceeding instituted against an officer or employee of LVB before the appointed date of the amalgamation shall be proceeded against such person under law as if LVB had not been dissolved. At the outset, the Supreme Court ruled that the aforementioned clause in the scheme must be interpreted in the backdrop of the context of the scheme of amalgamation, which was essentially to ensure recovery of LVB’s dues (as a result of its financial instability) and for the protection of its creditors. If therefore noted that: “the express mention of directors and such other individuals in the proviso means that it is to that extent only that prosecutions or other criminal proceedings can continue; in the ordinary sense, criminal liability can neither be attributed to DBS nor its directors, brought in after the amalgamation, whose appointments were approved by the RBI.” Since the original liability (if proven) was only those of the officials of the erstwhile LVB, the Court asserted that it remained unaffected by the amalgamation of LVB into DBS. Accordingly, it found no involvement of DBS, which is therefore devoid of any liability. The Court’s interpretation also seems heavily driven by the context of the amalgamation in which DBS effectively rescued the business of LVB which had become financially unviable. It also noted that “the public’s confidence in the banking industry was at stake”, and that to “permit prosecution of DBS for the acts of LVB officials … would result in travesty of justice.” In that sense, imposing liability on a successor bank would disincentivise white knights (such as DBS) from rescuing failing banks. Hence, the Supreme Court quashed the criminal proceedings against DBS. Analysis and Conclusion While the Supreme Court’s conclusion is understandable, the precedential value of the ruling is arguably limited, as it was confined to the specific facts and circumstances of the case. First, this involved a merger of two banks under the Banking Regulation Act rather than any other types of companies, whose merger would typically be governed by the Companies Act, 2013. Under section 242(3)(c) of the Companies Act, “the continuation by or against the transferee company of any legal proceedings pending by or against any transferor company on the date of transfer” would be determined by the order of the National Company Law Tribunal. However, under section 245(5)(e) of the Banking Regulation Act, the scheme of amalgamation prepared by the RBI can provide for the manner in, and extent to, which pending proceedings are continued against the transferee bank. This distinction is somewhat insignificant because, even in the case of non-banking companies, parties can effectively include the terms of dealing with legal proceedings in the scheme document which, if approved, by the tribunal would determine the nature of proceedings continued against the transferee company. Second, the fact that the LVB-DBS transaction was a compulsory merger rather than a consensual one seems to have mattered considerably. This had a significant bearing on how the Supreme Court interpreted the clauses in the scheme in the light of the concomitant provisions in the Banking Regulation Act. The public interest element involved in saving the depositors of LVB and preserving the credibility of the Indian banking industry militate against imposing fresh liabilities on the rescuer transferee entity. Perhaps a similar analysis may likely be inapplicable in the case of typical consensual merger, whether or two banking entities or other companies. Third, the timing of the liability matters substantially. In the present case, no criminal proceedings initiated by RFL were pending against LVB at the time the amalgamation came into effect, which was 27 November 2020. The proceedings were only against its officers. Hence, even the main prong of clause 3(3) (discussed earlier) states that only proceedings that are pending as on the appointed date would continue against the transferee bank, i.e., DBS. In the present case, since the supplementary proceedings were initiated against DBS only subsequent to the date of effectiveness of the amalgamation and no proceedings were pending against LVB prior to that date, the Court’s conclusion is somewhat more straightforward. If indeed criminal proceedings were to have been pending at the time of the amalgamation, the outcome may not have been so clearcut. Finally, the present case involved a criminal proceeding where the burden to impose the liability on a transferee company is justifiably high. However, the scenario may not be altogether similar if the proceedings in question led to civil liability. Banking Corporate Criminal Liability Mergers and Acquisitions RBI"

            "Restoring Equity: Supreme Court on Liquidator Discretion in IBC Bidding Process By GuestSeptember 13, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Priyanshu Mishra is a III year BA, LLB (Hons) student at the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru] Recently, in Eva Agro Feeds Pvt Ltd v Punjab National Bank (2023INSC809), the Supreme Court decisively clarified the extent of authority granted to a liquidator in rejecting the final bid within an online bidding process. This legal dispute revolved around the rights of the highest bidder and the liquidator’s discretion to reject the highest bid once the bidding process had concluded. A conflict arose between the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) and the E-Auction Process Information Document (hereinafter “Document”) regarding the liquidator’s authority. The Document delineates the procedural details of the bidding process for potential buyers. In this specific case, it conferred upon the liquidator the seemingly absolute power to either accept or reject any bid. However, it is essential to note that one of the clauses in the document required it to be interpreted in conjunction with the provisions of the IBC and associated regulations. The Court, in its deliberations, sought to harmonize and rectify the interpretation offered by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT(, which had seemingly endorsed unbridled authority for the liquidator. This was accomplished by placing the discretion of the liquidator within the framework of principles of natural justice. This post aims to expound upon the rationale employed by the Court while offering a critical assessment of the court’s decision to curtail the previously absolute and arbitrary powers vested in the liquidator. To achieve this objective, the post is structured into three distinct sections. First, it elucidates the Court’s reasoning behind its decision. Second, it outlines the existing legal position in this context. Third, it concludes by highlighting the far-reaching implications of the Court’s reasoning in this pivotal case. Harmonisation of E-Auction Document and the IBC In this case, it came to the Court’s attention that the bidding process had been conducted after the initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process. The liquidator duly issued notices for the sale of the property, and the appellant emerged as the sole bidder in the e-auction process, which was conducted in accordance with the terms outlined in the Document. The Court, in its deliberation, referred to this Document and identified several key clauses that needed consideration. Firstly, the Court noted that clause 2(m) of the Document must be interpreted in conjunction with the IBC. Additionally, it observed that clause 3(i) clarified that the Document did not constitute an agreement or an offer by the liquidator to the prospective buyer. Furthermore, clause 3(k) explicitly stated that the liquidator possessed absolute discretion to accept or reject any or all bids, to adjourn, postpone, or cancel the e-auction, or to withdraw any asset. The Supreme Court expressed reservations about the extensive discretion vested in the liquidator. It referred to para 1(11A) of schedule I of the Insolvency Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulation, 2016 (hereinafter “Regulation”), which mandated that the liquidator provide a justifiable reason for rejecting the highest bidder. However, the respondent’s counsel argued that this provision had only come into effect on 30 September 2021 and that it applied prospectively. Also, he argued that Schedule I clause 1(11) allows the liquidator to conduct multiple rounds of auction to maximise the realisation from the sale. Consequently, in the present case, there was no requirement for the liquidator to furnish a reason for cancelling the highest bid. The Court concurred with the argument concerning the prospective application of para 1(11A), but asserted that even then the arbitrary exercise of the liquidator’s discretion must be curtailed. It invoked the principle of natural justice to affirm that the act of “giving reasons” was an integral aspect of this principle, a point repeatedly upheld in various cases. The requirement to provide reasons implies the application of a reasoned judgment, which serves as a safeguard against arbitrary power. Furthermore, it argued that the “right to reason” was an inherent natural justice principle within the IBC, and para 1(11A) had merely conferred statutory recognition upon this well-established principle. Hence, the liquidator could not cancel the highest bid at their unfettered discretion and without offering any justification. Regarding the absolute and unfettered discretion granted to the liquidator under clause 3(k) of the Document, the Court construed it in conjunction with clause 2(m), which requires the information provided in the Document to be read in conjunction with sections 35 and 36 of the IBC on the power and duties of the liquidator in the legislation. Consequently, through a combined reading of the relevant clauses of the document and the provisions of the IBC, the Court determined that the highest bidder did not possess an absolute entitlement to demand acceptance of their bid. Nonetheless, the liquidator was obliged to exercise their judgment before rejecting the highest bidder’s offer, and this exercise of judgment must be evident in the rejection order itself. The Court harmoniously reconciled the Document’s provisions with the liquidator’s responsibilities under the IBC. Furthermore, the Court emphasized that the mere anticipation by the liquidator of obtaining a higher price was an insufficient basis for cancelling a legally valid auction. The logical outcome of this interpretation was that within an administrative framework like the IBC, the liquidator could not wield unrestricted or arbitrary discretionary authority. The IBC delineates clear duties and obligations for the liquidator, which must be executed objectively. The liquidator lacks the authority to arbitrarily nullify a legally valid auction. Principle of Natural Justice in the IBC To bolster its argument regarding the implicit nature of the “right to reason” in the liquidation process, the Court relied upon several precedents. In SN Mukherjee v Union of India, the Supreme Court established that the requirement to record reasons can be equated with the broader principle of natural justice. The overarching objective behind the principles of natural justice is to prevent miscarriages of justice and ensure the fair application of procedures. In State of Orissa v Dhaniram Luhar, the Court reiterated the paramount importance of providing reasons in decision-making, whether it is in the realm of administrative, quasi-judicial, or judicial actions. This underscores the critical role that reasons play in fostering transparency and accountability in the decision-making process. A similar ruling was delivered in East Coast Railway v Mahadev Appa Rao, where the Court recognized that arbitrariness in the issuance of orders by an authority can manifest itself through various means. The most effective way to demonstrate the application of due consideration and thoughtful judgment is by formally recording the reasons that led the authority to issue the specific order in question. In Kranti Association (P) Ltd v Masood Ahmed Khan, the Court emphasized that any order passed by a quasi-judicial or even an administrative authority must be articulate and well-reasoned. This requirement underscores the necessity for orders to be “speaking orders”, meaning they must convey the rationale and thought process behind the decision. Furthermore, the Court also contextualized the “right to hearing” within an administrative framework by referencing the AK Kraipak and Keshav Mills cases, where the distinction between quasi-judicial and administrative authorities became less distinct. These cases illuminate the evolving nature of administrative processes and the increasing importance of procedural fairness, including the right to be heard, in administrative decision-making. Furthermore, in the past, appellate courts have consistently affirmed the implicit presence of the principle of natural justice in the adjudication of disputes under the IBC. An illustrative case in this regard is Sree Metaliks Ltd v The Union of India, where a challenge was raised concerning the absence of the principle of natural justice under section 7 of the IBC. In its ruling, the Court firmly established that the adjudicating authority is duty-bound to afford a “reasonable opportunity of hearing” to the corporate debtor. This ruling effectively construed the “right to a fair hearing” as an inherent administrative rule within the framework of the IBC. Subsequently, in Starlog Enterprises Ltd. v. ICICI Bank Ltd., the Court further clarified that the “right to give notice” to the corporate debtor is a mandatory duty of the adjudicating authority to ensure a fair hearing. This interpretation solidified the importance of providing adequate notice in maintaining procedural fairness. In Era Infra Engineering Ltd. v. Prideco Commercial Pvt. Ltd., the Court once again emphasized the significance of the “right to notice”. This was particularly evident as the operational creditor failed to serve proper notice, thereby reaffirming the principle that notice is an integral component of due process. Likewise, in HS Oberoi Pvt Ltd v Inderjit Singh, the NCLAT upheld the principle of natural justice due to the adjudicating authority’s failure to offer an opportunity for a hearing, which constituted a violation of the fundamental principle of audi alterum partem. Therefore, these cases collectively underscore the consistent judicial recognition of the principle of natural justice in IBC disputes and highlight the critical importance of providing corporate debtors with a reasonable opportunity to be heard and duly informed. Conclusion  In the instant case of Eva Agro Feeds, the Supreme Court addressed a critical issue concerning the discretionary powers of a liquidator in rejecting the highest bid within an online bidding process. This case not only clarified the boundaries of the liquidator’s authority but also underscored the fundamental principles of natural justice within the context of the IBC. The Court’s decision in this case was grounded in a careful examination of both the E-Auction Process Information Document and the IBC. It highlighted the importance of transparency, fairness, and accountability in the liquidation process, asserting that the arbitrary exercise of discretion by the liquidator must be curtailed. In Eva Agro Feeds, the Court strikes a balance between the interests of the highest bidder and the responsibilities of the liquidator, setting a precedent that prioritizes fairness and due process. This judgment serves as a significant milestone in the evolution of insolvency and bankruptcy law, emphasizing the enduring relevance of natural justice principles in safeguarding the rights of stakeholders in the IBC framework. – Priyanshu Mishra Insolvency Liquidation"

            "SC Expands Scope of Enquiry under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act By GuestSeptember 11, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Raghav Bhatia is an advocate practising at the Supreme Court of India. He can be contacted at [email protected]]  In April this year, the Supreme Court of India in NTPC Ltd. v. SPML Infra Ltd. has expanded the scope of enquiry to be exercised by a court while referring the disputes for arbitration under section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (‘Arbitration Act’). Background NTPC Ltd. and SPML Infra Ltd. had entered into a contract for “Installation Services for Station Piping Package for Simhadri Super Thermal Power Project Stage II at NTPC at Simhadri, Vishakapatnam”. As required under the contract, SPML had furnished bank guarantees in favour of NTPC. Upon successful completion of the project, NTPC issued a completion certificate in SPML’s favour and informed SPML that it would release the final payment to it “upon the receipt of a No – Demand Certificate from SPML”, which was issued by SPML immediately thereafter. Accordingly, NTPC released the final amount but withheld the bank guarantees on account of disputes between the parties with respect to some other projects. As the parties failed to resolve the disputes, SPML filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court for the release of the bank guarantees. By way of an interim order dated July 8, 2019, the High Court directed NTPC not to encash the bank guarantees. The High Court also directed SPML to keep the bank guarantees alive till final adjudication of the disputes. During the pendency of the writ proceedings, the parties entered into a settlement agreement under which NTPC agreed to return SPML the bank guarantees and SPML agreed to withdraw its writ petition. SPML also agreed not to initiate arbitration against NTPC under the present contract. Following this, NTPC released the bank guarantees and SPML withdrew the writ petition. Subsequently, SPML resiled from the settlement agreement and filed a petition under section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act before the High Court for appointment of an arbitrator. The case of SPML was that by way of retaining the bank guarantees with itself, NTPC coerced SPML “to accept the terms of the Settlement Agreement”. By an order dated April 8, 2021, the High Court appointed an arbitral tribunal. Aggrieved, NTPC approached the Supreme Court. Proceedings before the Supreme Court At the outset, the Supreme Court noted that since its judgments in SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd. and National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd., among others, had broadened the scope of enquiry under section 11 of the Arbitration Act, the Parliament amended the Arbitration Act in 2015, thereby introducing section 11(6-A). Under section 11(6-A) of the Arbitration Act, the court while exercising referral jurisdiction would be required to limititself “to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement”. The Supreme Court cited its judgment in Duro Felguera, S. A. v. Gangavaram Port Limited and observed that following the insertion of section 11(6-A), the referral jurisdiction of a court “is limited to examining whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties – nothing more, nothing less”. In Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corporation, the Supreme Court authoritatively ruled that court undertakes a “prima facie review” at the referral stage. The prima facie review “is not full review but a primary first review to weed out manifestly and ex – facie non – existent and invalid arbitration agreement and non – arbitrable disputes” so as “to cut the deadwood”.   In light of the above, the Supreme Court in the instant case explained that the courts at the referral stage must undertake “two enquiries”: primary and secondary. Primary enquiry pertains to “the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement, which also includes an enquiry as to the parties to the agreement and the applicant’s privity to the said agreement” and the aforesaid enquiry requires “a thorough examination by the referral court”. The secondary inquiry is with respect to the non-arbitrability of the dispute. The Supreme Court observed that with respect to the defence of non-arbitrability, the arbitral tribunal “is the preferred first authority to determine and decide all questions of non – arbitrability”. The scope of enquiry while examining the issue of non-arbitrability is “prima facie”. Only in exceptional cases would the court reject reference where the claims are “manifestly and ex – facie non – arbitrable”. The Supreme Court noted that at the referral stage “courts must not undertake a full review of the contested facts: they must be only confined to a primary first review” and let the “facts speak for themselves”. However, the courts are required “to examine whether the assertion on arbitrability is bona fide or not”. At this stage, the courts will refer the disputes for arbitration even where “there is the slightest doubt”. On the other hand, courts will refuse to refer the parties for arbitration only where “there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is non – arbitrable”. This limited scrutiny is through the “eye of the needle”, which in the opinion of the Supreme Court is “necessary and compelling” as the referral court “is not expected to act mechanically merely to deliver a purported dispute raised by an applicant at the doors of the chosen arbitrator”.  Coming back to the facts of the present case, the Supreme Court observed that the High Court in the instant case erred in referring the disputes for arbitration, observing “that the allegations of coercion and economic duress are not bona fide, and that there were no pending claims between the parties for submission to arbitration”. The Supreme Court noted that the heart of the dispute revolved around the action of NTPC in not returning the bank guarantees even after SPML issued a no-demand certificate. At the time of withdrawal of writ petition, SPML did not raise any allegation of coercion or economic duress. Rather, SPML was only aggrieved by the act of NTPC interlinking the bank guarantees in question with another contract between the parties. The Supreme Court noted that the SPML’s allegations of coercion and economic duress were “an afterthought”. It was during the pendency of the writ proceedings that the parties entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement. This settlement agreement recorded that there were no subsisting disputes between the parties. The execution of the settlement agreement and the consequent release of the bank guarantees was never disputed by SPML. Thus, the Supreme Court concluded that in view of the settlement agreement between the parties, the claim of SPML in the section 11 proceedings was “ex facie frivolous and untenable”. Thus, this was a case in which the facts speak for themselves and, in such cases, the High Court ought to have declined reference of disputes to arbitration. Analysis  The author respectfully submits that in the given facts and circumstances of the case, the Supreme Court was right in allowing the NTPC’s appeal. As soon as a consensual comprehensive settlement agreement was executed between the parties, the disputes between the parties became non – existent and the referral court ought to have declined reference. In Vidya Drolia, the Supreme Court had held “the court may interfere at Section 8 or 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex facie certain that the arbitration agreement is non – existent, invalid or the disputes or non – arbitrable”.  However, the observations of the Supreme Court in the instant case regarding a thorough examination “of the existence and the validity of the arbitration agreement” to be carried out by the referral court are contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court previously. According to the judgments in Vidya Drolia and N. N. Global Mercantile Private Limited v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd., the court exercises prima facie jurisdiction at the referral stage. It is a summary jurisdiction and the intent of the legislature is to minimise judicial interference at the referral stage. Apart from section 11(6-A), this limited jurisdiction is to be understood in light of section 5 of the Arbitration Act, which provides for minimal judicial interference. Interestingly, by way of the 2019 Amendment to the Arbitration Act, section 11(6-A) has been deleted. However, its deletion has yet not been notified by the Parliament. In any case, the Supreme Court has noted in Vidya Drolia that even following its deletion, section 11(6-A) of the Arbitration Act and the reason behind its inclusion continues to guide a court’s jurisdiction at the referral stage. Mandating a thorough examination at the referral stage would defeat the very objective behind the enactment of the Arbitration Act. In fact, the Supreme Court in Shree Vishnu Constructions v. The Engineer in Chief, Military Engineering Service, while holding that courts must endeavour in deciding section 11 petitions within a period of six months, observed that delays in appointment of an arbitral tribunal would defeat the purpose behind the enactment of the Arbitration Act. Thus, the scope of court’s enquiry at the referral stage must be extremely limited and confined to the prima facie existence of the arbitration agreement. Recent Developments In May 2023, the Supreme Court in Magic Eye Developers Pvt. Ltd. v. Green Edge Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd referred to the instant judgment and observed that at the referral stage, the court has to decide the issue of existence and validity of an arbitration agreement “conclusively and finally and should not leave the said issue to be determined by the arbitral tribunal” as the same goes to the root of the matter. As the High Court in Magic Eye had referred the matter for arbitration without conclusively deciding the issue of existence and validity of the arbitration agreement, the Supreme Court remanded the matter back to the High Court. While both the instant judgment and Magic Eye are two judge bench decisions, and are in conflict with the law as explained by the Supreme Court in a five judge Bench decision in N. N. Global Mercantile and a three judge Bench decision in Vidya Drolia, the Supreme Court nonetheless must again clarify the limited jurisdiction which a court is expected to exercise at the referral stage. – Raghav Bhatia Arbitration"

            "SEBI’s Proposed Regulations on Finfluencers: Navigating Unresolved Practicalities By GuestSeptember 11, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Aamir Kapadia and Avinash Kotval are penultimate and final year BBA LL.B. (Hons.) student at Jindal Global Law School, Sonipat, respectively] On August 25, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’) released a consultation paper on ‘Association of SEBI Registered Intermediaries/Regulated Entities with Unregistered Entities (including Finfluencers)’. The purpose behind the consultation paper is to solicit public comments on various measures intended to clamp down on the association of SEBI-registered entities and intermediaries with unregistered ‘finfluencers’. While the proposed regulation purports to protect the interests of the average retail investor who may unseeingly heed to the guidance of unregistered finfluencers, certain vital questions remain unaddressed. Applicable Legal Regime As the Consultation Paper notes, financial influencers, or finfluencers, are “usually unregistered entities providing catchy content, information, and advice on various financial topics to their several followers”. While some finfluencers may be registered Investment Advisors (‘IA’) or Research Analysts (‘RA’), most operate as unregistered entities, often associated with a SEBI-registered entity or intermediary. Currently, finfluencers belong to a regulatory ‘grey area’. The SEBI (Investment Advisors) Regulations, 2013 (‘IA Regulations’) and the SEBI (Research Analysts) Regulations, 2014 (‘RA Regulations’) prohibit any person from acting as an IA or RA, respectively, without having obtained a certificate of registration from SEBI. Regulation 7 of the IA Regulations stipulate specific academic qualifications (and further certifications), and “at least five years of experience in “activities relating to advice in financial products or securities or fund or asset or portfolio management” to qualify for IA certification. The RA Regulations specify similar educational and professional qualifications required to be registered as a research analyst. Concerning compensation, an IA may not receive any payment from anyone other than the client being advised. Furthermore, an RA cannot accept any form of royalty/referral bonus from the entity employing them for research, and their compensation must also be reviewed annually by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by them. More importantly, an IA must open their securities transactions to scrutiny, as they cannot make any trades contrary to their own recommendations. Additionally, IAs need to customize their recommendations for every client based on their respective risk profiles. On the other hand, an RA, whose trades must be monitored, is prohibited from dealing in securities that they recommend or follow within thirty days before and five days after the publication of their report. RAs are also prohibited from making any trades contrary to their recommendations. Additionally, the National Stock Exchange, vide Circular PNSE/COMP/55482, requires that any payment made by brokers to influencers is approved by the stock exchange and includes disclosures. It also prohibits influencers having more than 10 lakh followers from being part of advertisements. Regulatory requirements on possessing appropriate qualifications, scrutiny of trades and non-gratuitous contact with anyone other than those being advised are arguably the primary reasons finfluencers are hesitant to obtain requisite registrations as IAs and RAs. Frequently, finfluencers receive what the consultation paper notes as undisclosed financial compensation from SEBI-registered entities and intermediaries. In return for such compensation, they influence their followers by providing investment advice despite often lacking qualifications mandated by the law to be an IA. Not only will a considerable number of finfluencers not qualify to be registered as an IA or RA, even if they do have the necessary qualifications, there will be a regulatory bar from obtaining any compensation from the registered entities or intermediaries, as the finfluencers are not providing any investment advice to these entities. Proposed Regulations SEBI noted concerns with unregistered finfluencers, who may entice their followers to purchase products, services or securities in return for compensation from platforms or producers which are not disclosed to the followers. Therefore, it recognised a need to curb the flow of such compensation from registered intermediaries or regulated entities with such unregistered entities. Furthermore, being unregistered, such finfluencers may not have the requisite qualifications or expertise on the subject, nor are they subject to a code of conduct requiring disclosures of conflicts of interests, etc. Therefore, SEBI has proposed to prohibit registered intermediaries, regulated entities or their representatives from, directly or indirectly, having any association/relationship with any unregistered entities for the promotion of their services or products. They would also be prohibited from sharing confidential information of their clients with such unregistered entities. It has also proposed prohibiting registered intermediaries or regulated entities from paying any trailing commission based on the number of referrals as a referral fee. However, it has proposed a carve-out for limited referrals from retail clients and payment of fees for such limited referrals by stockbrokers. Furthermore, SEBI registered intermediaries/registered entities may be required to take active measures to dissociate themselves from any unregistered entity using their name, product or service, and take necessary action through enforcement agencies, including by registering cases under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. Critical Analysis of the Proposed Regulations The proposed regulations outlined in the consultation paper appear to be a positive step in addressing the negative impacts that may arise from biased and potentially financially motivated advice provided by unregistered finfluencers to their followers. However, some critical questions regarding the practical implementation of these regulations have not been addressed. The first important question vis-à-vis the implementation of the proposed regulations pertains to the lack of clarity regarding how content published by unregistered finfluencers, in violation of any existing or proposed regulations on this matter, will be dealt with. Today’s finfluencers give investment advice through various social media and content-hosting platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. Currently, matters pertaining to taking down content on the internet are governed by the Information Technology Act, 2000, read with the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 and the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by the Public) Rules, 2009. The procedures for the same are arduous and lengthy – blocking content in breach of the statutory framework through this route would be impractical and could hinder the effective implementation of the proposed regulations. By the time necessary procedures and formalities are completed, irreversible damage, vis-à-vis influencing retail investors, will have likely occurred. A second important question that could be worthwhile for the securities watchdog to consider would be the applicability of the proposed regulations on non-resident unregistered finfluencers dispensing advice to Indian residents. The Supreme Court in Securities and Exchange Board of India v. Pan Asia Advisors Ltd. held that SEBI’s jurisdiction extends to any person, including “citizens abroad” and those not “corporally present” in India committing an act which “affects the legitimate interest of this country”. Therefore, clarity on enforcement of the proposed regulations to such influencers may be beneficial. Further, jurisdictions like the United States and Hong Kong require investment advisors (or their domestic equivalents) to be registered with, or obtain requisite licenses from regulatory authorities to provide investment advice. Thus, recognition of finfluencers registered in their respective jurisdictions may also be looked into. Finally, while the proposed regulations seek to address the threat posed by finfluencers through the regulation of registered intermediaries, SEBI has also expressed an intention to take enforcement action against all finfluencers in breach of existing SEBI Regulations. Therefore, a critical question left unanswered is the very applicability of the IA and RA Regulations to finfluencers. SEBI, in the consultation paper, refers to finfluencers as “effectively unregistered and unauthorized Investment  Advisers (IAs) or Research  Analysts (RAs)”. However, the proviso to Regulation 2(l) of the IA Regulations, defining ‘investment advice’, explicitly excludes “advice given through newspaper, magazines, any electronic or broadcasting or telecommunications medium, which is widely available to the public” from the ambit of investment advice. This seemingly results in a conundrum concerning the applicability of the regulations on finfluencers. This question has become relevant in light of SEBI’s recent Settlement Order in respect of Mansun Consultancy Private Limited, Mr. P.R. Sundar and Ms. Mangayarkarsi Sundar. Mr. P.R. Sundar, who provided investment advice through his website and telegram channels, was said to have provided said investment advice without obtaining the requisite registration under the IA regulations. The Settlement Order was issued without considering the proviso to the definition, by which arguably Mr. P.R. Sundar was not providing any investment advice to his followers. A modification to this definition to the necessary extent of including the advice usually dispensed by finfluencers would resolve this theoretical regulatory roadblock. ConclusionThe widespread dissemination of unchecked investment advice by unregulated finfluencers poses a significant threat to the public. This threat is magnified by the potentially financially incentivized nature of investment advice given by such influencers, which is not disclosed to the unassuming retail investor. The consultation paper represents a commendable stride toward essential regulatory measures to mitigate these potential harms, safeguarding the financial interests of investors and promoting responsible financial content. Resolving the questions raised in this post would aid in establishing a robust mechanism for mitigating the potential risks associated with such advice. – Aamir Kapadia & Avinash Kotval Information Technology SEBI Securities Regulation"

            "Receipt of Demand Notice under IBC: Whether Price Sensitive Information? By GuestSeptember 9, 20238 Min read1 comment   [Ravishekhar Pandey and Amarpal Singh Dua are with MDP & Partners, Mumbai]  The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) on 12 July 2023 passed an order relating to the scrip of Shilpi Cable Technologies Limited (“STCL”) imposing penalty on the Managing Director (“MD”) as well as the Compliance Officer for violations of securities laws. In the order, the Adjudicating Officer (“AO”) appointed by SEBI arrived at a conclusion that the receipt of a demand notice under section 8 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”) falls within the definition unpublished price sensitive information (“UPSI”). Brief Facts  SEBI carried out an investigation in the scrip of STCL. During the investigation, it was found that between 26 April 2017 and 11 May 2017 the share price of STCL fell from Rs. 218.25 to Rs. 71.25 on the National Stock Exchange Ltd. (“NSE”) and from Rs. 218.35 to Rs. 70.95 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (“BSE”). On 10 March 2017, STCL received a demand notice under section 8 of the IBC from Macquarie Bank. The debt was acknowledged by the company and subsequently an application for initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process (“CIRP”) of STCIL was filed on 3 April 2017. The application was admitted by the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”), New Delhi by way of its order dated 24 May 2017. The company had made a corporate announcement to the BSE on 30 April 2017 and to the NSE on 11 May 2017. A Show Cause Notice was issued to the MD of STCL alleging that he had passed on the information with respect to receipt of demand notice under section 8 of IBC to certain entities who sold shares in large quantities before the corporate announcement and that, as a result, there was a sharp decrease in price of the shares of STCL as stated above. Therefore, the MD was alleged to have violated the provisions of the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulation), 2015 (“PIT Regulations”) and the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations, 2003 (“PFTUP Regulations”). Findings The AO in her order concluded that service of demand notice is a pre-requisite under section 8 of IBC for the initiation of a CIRP under section 9 of the IBC. Furthermore, the AO held that the receipt of demand notice is an event which indicates that the company has defaulted in its obligation to repay the debt and the company may undergo CIRP in the near future. This is a negative event and may affect the price of the shares, if disclosed to the public. Thus, the receipt of demand notice falls under the definition of UPSI as defined under regulation 2(1)(n) of the PIT Regulations. Additionally, it was also held that since the MD had close connection with entities who had sold shares of STCL before the corporate announcement, it can be presumed that the MD had passed on the above information to the entities who traded based on the information which led to sudden fall in the share price of  STCL. Therefore, the AO imposed a penalty of Rs. 15 lakh on the MD for violating provisions of the PIT Regulations and the PFTUP Regulations. Analysis It is important to consider what constitutes UPSI before venturing into the analysis. Regulation 2(ze) of PIT Regulations defines UPSI as information regarding the company or its securities, directly or indirectly, which is not generally available; and if the information is made generally available, it is likely to affect the price of the securities. It includes (i) financial results; (ii). dividends; (iii) change in capital structure; (iv) mergers, de-mergers, acquisitions, delisting, disposals, and expansion of business; (v) changes in key managerial personnel. In the case of Shruti Vora v. SEBI, the appellants had traded based on certain WhatsApp messages which were in circulation relating to the financials of certain companies before the financial results were published. After the publication of financial results, it was found that the information in the messages closely matched with the published financial results. Consequently, SEBI passed an order imposing penalty on the appellants and held that the WhatsApp messages constitute UPSI. The order was challenged before the Securities Appeallate Tribunal (“SAT”) and, while setting aside the order, SAT observed that SEBI in its order did not consider contention of the appellants that the information could be heard on streets in the form of gossips or expert guidance which is also published on platforms like Bloomberg. Later, the Supreme Court of India also refused to interfere with order passed by SAT. Furthermore, in  Samir C. Arora v. SEBI, the price sensitive information on the basis of which the appellant was alleged to have traded did not turn out be true. In view of the above, it was held by SAT  that “any information which turns out be false or at least uncertain does not fall under the UPSI”. Therefore, based on the above, an inference can be drawn that information to be qualified as UPSI warrants that such information should be specific, accurate, precise, and definite. Initiation of CIRP after Receipt of Demand Notice is Always Uncertain  It is always uncertain whether the service of demand notice on the company under section 8 of the IBC will result into initiation of a CIRP or not. Section 8 of IBC states that in case of default the operational creditor must serve a demand notice to the company. After the receipt of the demand notice, the company must bring to the knowledge of the creditor any pre-existing dispute with respect to the debt or acknowledge the unpaid amount within 10 days. If the company acknowledges the unpaid amount and there is no pre-existing dispute or the company has not responded to the demand notice within 10 days, the creditor can file an application before the NCLT for initiation of CIRP of the company under section 9 of the IBC. However, in case there is a pre-existing dispute between the company and the creditor regarding the debt,  the receipt of demand notice will not lead to initiation of a CIRP. There have also been instances where applications for initiation of CIRP under section 9 of IBC have been rejected on several grounds such as pre-existing dispute relating to rendered goods / services and  improper service of demand notice (improper form). For instance, in Neeraj Jain v. Cloudwalker Streaming Technologies Private Ltd., the NCLT, Bengaluru passed an order for initiating CIRP in respect of Flipkart Private Limited under section 9 of the IBC. The order was challenged before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (“NCLAT”) inter alia on the ground that the demand notice delivered was improper and incomplete. The NCLAT held that the demand notice served to Flipkart in Form 3 of  Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2016 did not mention the details of the debt, and that the documents required to prove the existence of such debt are not attached along with demand notice. Therefore, the order passed by the NCLT Bengaluru for initiating CIRP of Flipkart was set aside. In view of the above discussion, it can be concluded that the initiation of the CIRP of a company after receipt of demand notice is always uncertain and depends on various factor until an order is passed by the NCLT for initiation of the CIRP after hearing the parties and considering all the relevant material. Conclusion Since the initiation of CIRP after the receipt of demand notice under section 8 of IBC is uncertain, it cannot ipso facto qualify as UPSI under the PIT Regulations. The attending circumstances such as the trading pattern around the proceedings under the IBC must be closely analyzed before determining the charge of insider trading. It is also pertinent to point out that what constitutes as UPSI under the PIT Regulations depends on the individual facts and circumstances of each case. While in the present case it is apparent from the trading pattern of the noticees that the sell trades intensified when the demand notice was received, and the application for initiation of the CIRP was filed before the NCLT. The company was eventually admitted into CIRP and is presently under liquidation. It is therefore apparent from the order that the AO has rightly determined the PIT violation; however, the determination of UPSI is not in conformity with the existing law. – Ravishekhar Pandey & Amarpal Singh Dua Insider Trading Insolvency SEBI Securities Regulation"

            "Unwinding and Rewinding the Clock: Revisiting Interim Reliefs under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act By GuestSeptember 9, 20236 Min readAdd comment   [Sumit Chatterjee is an Advocate at Arista Chambers, Bangalore] Interims reliefs under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”) underwent a significant change following the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 (“2015 Amendment”). Under the Act, parties can approach the Court under section 9 of the Act to seek interim reliefs before, or during the arbitral proceedings, or at any time after the passing of the award but before it is enforced. Interim reliefs are an essential safeguard provided under the Act to ensure that any claims which a party wishes to raise in the arbitration are protected in the form of security, guarantees or other measures as the Court may deem fit, based on a case-to-case assessment. Post the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, the tribunal itself is also empowered to grant interim reliefs to parties under section 17 of the Act. The 2015 Amendment brought a number of changes which were aimed at reducing judicial interference in the arbitral process. One of these changes was the amendment to section 9 of the Act. Through the addition of sub-section (3) to section 9, the court’s powers to grant interim reliefs were truncated, once the arbitral tribunal had been constituted. The 2015 Amendment also introduced a deeming fiction in section 17, to ensure that orders of the arbitral tribunal in respect of interim reliefs would have the same effect as, and could be enforced on the same strength as, orders of the competent Court under section 9. The addition of sub-section (3) to section 9 recognised that since the powers to grant interim reliefs had effectively been made equal for both courts and arbitral tribunals after the 2015 Amendment, parties should raise their claims for such interim reliefs before the tribunal, once it is constituted. Section 9(3) thus flowed from the principle of minimal judicial interference in arbitral proceedings, as also enshrined in section 5 of the Act. However, the restriction placed on the Court’s scope under section 9 by sub-section (3) is based on two assertions. First, on its power to ‘entertain’ an application under sub-section (1), and second, qualified by an assessment of whether there exist circumstances which may render the remedy of interim relief under section 17 inefficacious. Therefore,  a section 9 court does not become coram non judice as soon as the arbitral tribunal is constituted. Further, its jurisdiction is also not completely taken away through sub-section (3), as it is not meant to operate as an ouster clause. The Supreme Court’s Current Legal Position  The court’s jurisdiction would remain intact under section 9 in cases where it came to the conclusion that the interim relief sought would become inefficacious under section 17 of the  Act. As was explained by the Supreme Court in Arcelor Mittal Nippon Steel India Ltd. v Essar Bulk Terminal Ltd., such a situation could arise in circumstances where the arbitral tribunal is unavailable due to reasons of illness etc., where members of the arbitral tribunal cannot congregate on short notice to decide the urgency in the interim application, or where the constitution of the tribunal itself is under challenge on grounds of bias etc. inter alia. Since interim reliefs are, by their very nature, urgent and require immediate intervention, the Supreme Court in Arcellor Mittal held that the intention of the legislature under section 9 would therefore not be to denude the court’s powers – particularly in situations where the tribunal’s indisposition would render availing such remedy under section 17 inefficacious. While the Supreme Court’s observations of the conditional clause in sub-section (3) in Arcellor Mittal were helpful in clarifying its scope (yet fairly uncontroversial), it was the its interpretation of ‘entertain’ which made for interesting reading – and laid down the law for section 9 courts to follow in the future. In Arcellor Mittal, the Supreme Court held that the word ‘entertain’ under section 9(3) means when a court under section 9 has applied its mind to the issues raised in the application, and has considered it on merits. It concluded that while such a process might even extend till the pronouncement of the order on such an application, it would not preclude the court from exercising its powers under section 9 even if the tribunal was constituted during this stage. Such an interpretation is premised on the fundamental policies underlying the arbitral process – time-effective dispute resolution and efficiency. The Supreme Court’s interpretation of ‘entertain’ in section 9(3) ensures that parties do not have to undergo a redundant process of having to re-agitate their claim for interim relief before the arbitral tribunal, even after such a claim was taken up and considered (albeit not fully – as was the case in Arcellor Mittal) by the court under section 9. The intent was never, as the Supreme Court observed, to “turn back the clock” and require the arbitral tribunal to re-consider an application for interim relief which has already been seized of by the section 9 court. Calcutta High Court Relied Upon the Supreme Court’s Position This policy-based interpretative approach in Arcellor Mittal continues to hold the field in the interpretation of section 9(3) of the Act, and was recently relied upon by the Calcutta High Court in its decision in Jaya Industries v Mother Diary Calcutta and another . In Jaya Industries, the High Court had issued a show cause notice on Mother Diary to show cause as to why it should not be directed to deposit an amount towards Jaya Industries’ claim in the arbitration before the Court. While the parties filed affidavits towards their respective positions in the section 9 proceedings, the arbitral tribunal was constituted in the interregnum. The High Court, applying the ratio in Arcellor Mittal, held that while the level of a court’s engagement with an application may be subjective depending on each case (and at which point the tribunal stood constituted), it was clear that in the present case that the High Court had effectively ‘entertained’ the said application when the tribunal was constituted. The intention under section 9(3), the High Court reiterated, was not to “rewind the clock”. It was to prevent multiple hearings on the same relief claimed by the parties, as a result of which once the Court has ‘entertained’ the application – by applying its mind to the issues at hand and considering it on merits – the hands of the metaphorical clock under section 9, and sub-section (3) specifically, stop to tick. Conclusion The Calcutta High Court’s decision in Jaya Industries provides another example of the policy-based interpretive approach under section 9(3) being used to good effect by the court in preventing parties from having to undergo multiple hearings on interim relief applications under the Act. While the Supreme Court’s ratio in Arcellor Mittal continues to remain the leading precedent on the issue, it will be interesting to see how future courts apply the same in cases where the timelines between the constitution of the tribunal, and the section 9 Court’s ‘entertaining’ the application, are not as straightforward and distant as in the cases discussed in this post.   – Sumit Chatterjee Arbitration"

            "Hybrid Settlements and Presumption of Innocence: The Conundrum of Verdict Under Veil By GuestSeptember 8, 202310 Min readAdd comment   [Ishita Mishra is a fourth-year B.B.A. LL. B (Hons.) student at Symbiosis Law School, Pune] The European Commission (‘Commission’) issued its decision to establish the participation of Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS, and Société Générale in a cartel in the market for Euro Interest Rate Derivatives (‘EIRD’). The decision was adopted through a settlement procedure wherein the banks received a 10% reduction in fines on admission of facts presented by the Commission. In parallel, the investigation surrounding HSBC, Crédit Agricole, and JP Morgan was finalized under the standard sanctioning proceedings. HSBC later challenged the decision of the Commission establishing the participation of HSBC, Crédit Agricole, and JP Morgan in the EIRD cartel before the General Court (‘GC’) on the violation of presumption of innocence and the right of defence which was consequently dismissed. Subsequently, HSBC appealed on the same basis before the European Court of Justice (‘ECJ’).   A pattern discernible from the European Union’s (‘EU’) experience is the hesitance and the cautious approach towards hybrid settlements: a bifurcated procedure adopted within a single proceeding wherein the Commission makes a decision against certain parties who follow the settlement procedure, alongside a separate decision against other parties that discontinue the settlement procedure. Non-settling parties in such instances appeal against the standard Commission decision, citing violations of the presumption of innocence, the right to defence, and the right to a fair trial. In contrast, India has recently introduced settlements through the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2023 (‘Amendment Act’), aiming to enhance efficiency of the Competition Commission of India (‘CCI’) on the enforcement front.  The post delves into the well-established antitrust framework of the EU and the inherent challenges in the inevitable case of hybrid settlements. It explores the primary obstacle of the ‘staggered’ approach in the hybrid settlement decisions and what the CCI could take from the deficiencies observed within the EU’s antitrust regime to harmonize procedural efficiency and non-settling party rights in the hybrid settlement mechanism.  Hybrid Settlements Within the Settlement Mechanism The Commission uses settlement methods to make anti-competitive decisions expeditiously. Parties must admit misconduct and reach a ‘common understanding’ on facts and legality, with a 10% fine reduction if successful. This procedure grants the Commission swifter administrative processing, thereby conserving resources and minimizing appeals. It was introduced in the EU by Regulation 1/2003 for vertical infringements and cartels. In 2016, its application was broadened to cover the incidence of abuse of dominance. Hybrid settlements involve a dual process: the Commission adopts a settlement decision for cooperating parties and a standard decision for non-cooperating parties. Procedural safeguards are critical for the non-settling party’s presumption of innocence and right of defence. Hybrid settlements are a product of a mature and developed competition regime in the EU in contrast to the Indian regulations, which have more recently introduced the settlement mechanism through the Amendment Act through the addition of section 48A to the Competition Act, 2002. The introduced mechanism enables implicated entities in alleged anti-competitive vertical agreements and abuse of dominance cases to propose settlements after the Director General’s investigative report, preceding the final CCI adjudication. This process necessitates admission of guilt under section 48A(3), contrasting with the section 48B(3) commitment proceedings using ‘alleged contravention’. The CCI has the discretionary ability to approve or reject settlements with no appeals. It is undisputed that the new mechanism will help the CCI on its enforcement front. However, it also lacks application in cartel cases.  The inevitability of encountering hybrid settlement scenarios places the CCI in a pivotal position, necessitating a cautious approach. The CCI must judiciously approach the situation, maintaining harmony between the interests of both settling and non-settling parties, in order to enhance the overall effectiveness of the settlement procedure. The EU Approach  In the case of Pometon SpA , the ECJ established that the Commission can refer to a non-settling party in a settlement decision if such reference is necessary to prove the liability of the settling party. Consequently, the Commission must exercise due diligence and precision when formulating settlement decisions in hybrid settlements. The determination of whether the Commission violated the presumption of innocence centres on a case-specific assessment of whether appropriate precautions were taken during the formulation and drafting of the settlement decision. Similarly, the decision to disclose information about the non-settling party must be meticulously examined, and such disclosure should only be made to the extent necessary to establish the liability of the settling party. Implementing such precautionary measures is pivotal to ensure a fair trial with the essential principle of presumption of innocence and the right of defence. In Pometon, the ECJ drew upon a judgement by the European Court of Human Rights and its own jurisprudence. These cases pertained to criminal proceedings wherein several accused could not be tried together. The ECJ highlighted that referencing separately prosecuted individuals can be deemed ‘necessary’ only while ascertaining the guilt of those on trial, given the potential violation of the presumption of innocence for co-suspects. This emphasizes the necessity principle, requiring judicial constraint within strict confines solely to establish the culpability of the individual being tried. In this context, judicious language selection during decision formulation is critical. Precision and accuracy are required to avoid potential premature judgment that can jeopardize the fair examination of the third parties. The Court applied this precedent mutatis mutandis to hybrid settlement cases in competition law proceedings. The assessment of whether the Commission maintained the presumption of innocence for non-settling parties in hybrid settlements must be determined on a case-specific basis, considering distinct reasoning, facts, and circumstances. Similarly, in the HSBC case, the ECJ ruled that the presumption of innocence would be compromised if the authority, lacking a final conviction, explicitly asserts the non-settling party’s involvement. Consequently, the settlement decision should incorporate only information strictly essential regarding the non-settling party. To determine such an ‘explicit declaration by the authority’, the ECJ scrutinized whether adequate drafting safeguards were in place to preserve the presumption of innocence for non-settling parties. The Court additionally examined public statements by the Commissioner responsible for competition policy when the order was issued. Ultimately, the ECJ determined that necessary precautions were taken to safeguard the right to a fair trial, leading to the dismissal of action taken by HSBC. In Scania, which involved a hybrid settlement, the GC examined every reference to Scania, a non-settling party, within the settlement decision. References to Scania using terms like ‘amongst others’ were subject to analysis, and the Court determined that these references did not constitute a definitive assertion of the non-settling party’s liability. The Court’s reasoning drew upon Pometon, affirming that the admission of wrongdoing by a settling party does not automatically transform the references made to said party into explicit declarations. Thus, measures are taken against a settlement decision being equated to a verdict under veil for the non-settling party.  The ‘Staggered Approach’ and Concurrent Adjudication Within the EU, such hybrid decisions are commonly structured in a ‘staggered’ manner. Under such an approach, the standard decision is adopted subsequent to the settlement decision. This bifurcated procedure leads to intricacies as the settling parties are found to have engaged in competition infringement. These intricacies ripple through the effect of such a decision on non-settling parties, both from the perspective of the settlement order and the ensuing standard decision. Consequently, appeals arise from the non-settling parties with the settlement order being perceived as a verdict under veil: the authorities connecting the settlement order of the settling parties with a presumption of guilt for the non-settling parties in the standard procedure. Thus, how the non-settling parties and their conduct is characterized under it and the conduct of the Commission subsequent to such verdict as once a settlement order has been passed, maintaining a strictly impartial attitude of the authorities in the standard procedure can be a difficult task.  Therefore, complexities arise in maintaining the presumption of innocence against such non-settling party while drafting the final settlement order and in the Commission ensuring strict impartiality in its actions following the issuance of such an order. The ECJ has upheld the validity of this staggered approach while emphasizing the importance of the presumption of innocence and guaranteeing a fair trial.  Accordingly, the CCI can contemplate aligning its procedural framework with a unified approach, departing from the staggered EU model. This shall entail a concurrent adjudication of the settlement order and the standard decision, enduring efficiency, and safeguarding non-settling parties from a prejudiced proceeding, as it may be difficult to correctly measure the settling parties’ involvement without considering the non-settling parties. Moreover, the CCI should closely analyze the procedural efficiency of following a hybrid approach in a particular case prior to its application to avoid complexities and can entirely decide to discontinue such process under such circumstances. Adopting such concurrent procedure shall also offer a solution to the intricate challenge of discerning the necessity of references to the non-settling party within the settlement order. As held in Pometon, the non-settling party cannot assert based on the presumption of innocence for the Commission to completely ignore or avoid facts that the settling party has already admitted.  Hence, the viability of adopting a concurrent decision hinges upon the ability to preserve the delicate equilibrium between the interests of both settling and non-settling parties. This approach strives to maintain the expeditious and efficient advantage of the settlement procedure while protecting the presumption of innocence of the parties and guaranteeing them a fair trial. If not maintained, the quest to resolve the right of fair trial of the non-settling party can impede the effective enforcement of competition law or vice versa.  Furthermore, alongside the practice of a concurrent decision or even in the absence of it, the CCI could implement a preliminary strategy of designating separate teams for the bifurcated process. While this might necessitate increased resource allocation and comparative efficiency losses, with both the teams taking more time to be familiar with the case at hand, it constitutes a sacrifice the CCI shall have to undertake to dispense any doubt regarding an impartial examination of the case.  Way Forward Against the backdrop of the recent introduction of the settlement mechanism in India, it brings forth a novel dimension; however, the incorporation and the inevitable issue of a hybrid settlement shall present a clear impediment to its effective enforcement. Thus, it is imperative for the CCI to take a cue from the limitations of the EU’s mature competition framework and approach this arena with prudence. Such a stance is indispensable to safeguard the presumption of innocence, the right to defence, and a fair trial.  A potential departure from the contentious staggered approach adopted in the EU could offer the CCI a viable alternative, provided the balance between the interests of settling and non-settling parties is diligently preserved. Nonetheless, achieving such a balance is a formidable task that could potentially undermine the foundational efficiency value of the settlement procedure. Being a more moderate and less drastic approach, the CCI can allocate distinct teams to handle the settlement and standard procedures. Although this resolution might need additional allocation of CCI’s resources, it must be deemed imperative to enhance the effectiveness of the hybrid procedure. The most effective resolution for determining the optimal balance between hybrid settlements and procedural efficiency remains an ongoing discourse in the mature competition regime of the EU. – Ishita Mishra Competition Law International Developments"

            "Evaluating India’s Regulatory Regime for ESG Rating Agencies By GuestSeptember 6, 20237 Min readAdd comment   [Shouvik Kumar Guha is an Associate Professor of Law and Sourav Paul a fourth year undergraduate student, both at the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata] On July 3, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’), introduced the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Credit Rating Agencies) (Amendment) Regulations, 2023 (‘Regulation’) to amend the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999. The primary objective of the Regulation is to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework that governs the operations of the ESG rating agencies in India. The Regulation, inter-alia, attempts to set out rules regarding the registration of ESG rating agencies, their code of conduct, the process of ESG rating, and imposes disclosure obligations. This article focuses on the ESG rating agencies as specified in the Regulation and analyse the SEBI’s approach in regulating the same. SEBI’s Position in the Consultation Paper  Prior to the notification of the Regulation, SEBI released a consultation paper on ESG Rating Providers for Securities Markets to understand the concerns related to the unregulated ESG rating agencies in India. SEBI came up with this consultation paper after the International Organisation of Securities Commissions’ report on ‘ESG Ratings and Data Product Providers’. In the consultation paper, SEBI acknowledged the ambiguity and inconsistency in ESG products, such as ESG Impact Ratings, and ESG Corporate Risk Ratings. Furthermore, it noted that there is a potential risk of greenwashing since there is no uniformity in the rating methodologies. Greenwashing refers to deceptive practicesemployed by businesses to portray themselves as more environmentally sustainable. In the consultation paper, SEBI proposed with regards to the ESG rating process that the rating methodology for a specific product should be consistent across all assigned ratings. Further, the ESG rating agencies are required to exercise due diligence and independent professional judgment to maintain objectivity and independence. However, it would have been prudent to provide more explicit standards for such diligence and judgment to enhance the reliability of the rating process. SEBI also undertook an in-depth analysis of the business model of the ESG rating agencies and compared it with the business models of the credit rating agencies. It noted that credit rating agencies follow an ‘issuer-pay’ model primarily because a credit rating is a mandatory requirement for the issuance of securities or listing in the markets. On the other hand, globally, ESG rating agencies follow a ‘subscriber-pay’ model where investors can subscribe to the rating services as there is no requirement for an ESG rating before the issuance of securities or listing in the markets. SEBI noted that a ‘subscriber-pay’ model may give rise to potential conflict of interest concerns. For instance, an investor subscribing to a specific rating offered by an ESG rating agency could demand a customised analysis based on the company’s goals. SEBI also recommended the ESG rating agencies to form specialised committees to execute the rating process. However, it refrained from proposing any standard rating scale to be followed by all the registered ESG rating agencies in India. This cautious approach may be based on the understanding that with the ESG landscape in India still being at a nascent stage and the markets constantly evolving, a premature imposition of such standard may hinder the natural growth of the industry. Further, this business model puts smaller investors in terms of monetary capacity at a disadvantageous position. Upon reviewing the proposed framework relating to ESG rating agencies, it is evident that SEBI has followed an approach similar to the consultation paper. In the subsequent section, we analyse and comment on the SEBI’s framework related to ESG rating agencies under the Regulation. Analysing the Regulatory Framework for the ESG Rating Agencies The Regulation has laid down stringent eligibility criteria for ESG rating agencies seeking registration from SEBI. Regulation 28E, inter-alia, mandates that they are required to submit a detailed business plan regarding ESG rating activity in India. Further, the targets mentioned in the business plan must be strictly related to their proposed operation in the Indian securities market and must be reasonable. SEBI, while framing the Regulation, has placed enhanced emphasis on the transparency and governance aspects of ESG rating agencies. As per the Regulation, they are required to maintain a website and disclose material information related to the ESG rating process. They also need to disclose their rating methodologies keeping in mind the confidential aspects of such methodologies. If there are any changes in the rating methodology, the ESG rating agencies are also required to explain the consequential changes on their website. The Regulation has made it mandatory to frame policies related to conflicts of interest, which needs to be published on the website. There is a blanket restriction on rating entities connected with the promoter of the ESG rating agency. The ESG rating agencies are also required to appoint a compliance officer to ensure compliance with the applicable laws. In case of any non-compliance, the compliance officer must report independently to SEBI on an immediate basis. Such measures would ensure information symmetry among the various classes of investors related to the functioning of ESG rating agencies. To prevent shareholding interlocks in the ESG rating sector, SEBI has introduced shareholding restrictions in the Regulation. An ESG rating agency cannot hold more than 10% of shareholding either directly or indirectly in any other ESG rating agency. SEBI’s approval is required if any ESG rating agency intends to acquire shares or voting rights exceeding 10% in any other ESG rating agency. Further, to prevent director interlocks, an ESG rating agency cannot have a representation on the board of directors of any other ESG rating agency. The global market for ESG rating agencies is heavily dominated by a few entities–MSCI ESG, Sustainalytics, RepRisk, and ISS Environmental & Social QualityScore. The shareholding restrictions would prevent such consolidation in this nascent industry. Further, restrictions related to board interlocks would prevent collusion among the ESG rating agencies. The Regulation has laid down broad guidelines pertaining to the ESG rating process and monitoring of the ratings. SEBI has mandated that the ESG rating agencies should have written policies, procedures, and internal controls to ensure consistency in the application of the rating methodologies. Notably, SEBI has mandated the ESG rating agencies to consider the unique features of the Indian securities market while assigning ESG ratings. Additionally, they are required to periodically update and review their rating methodologies. The ratings of their client need to be continuously monitored unless the rating is withdrawn by SEBI. The Regulation mandates the ESG rating agencies to review their published ESG ratings either annually or more frequently as needed. Further, the agencies should have advanced technological tools to track the material developments related to ESG to update the ratings in a timely manner. Under the Regulation, SEBI has imposed specific disclosure obligations on the ESG rating agencies. The Regulation stipulates that such an agency is required to disclose the definitions and symbols of their ratings. Further, the agencies must explicitly mention that their ESG ratings should not be considered as recommendations to buy, hold, or sell any securities. In sum, SEBI has imposed stringent compliance requirements and introduced corporate governance norms in the regulatory framework governing ESG rating agencies in India. Transparency and accountability on the part of the ESG rating agencies are the key underlying principles contained in the Regulation. However, the Regulation is silent on the potential risk of greenwashing since ESG disclosures are unaudited. Further, with the mandatory filing of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reports from the financial year 2022-2023 for the top 1000 listed entities, the lack of uniformity in the ESG rating methodologies may facilitate false reporting. Conclusion The rise of ESG investing has significantly influenced the importance of ESG rating agencies within the capital markets ecosystem. These agencies play a pivotal role, since the investment community relies on ESG scores to identify sustainable investment portfolios. The purpose of ESG ratings is to provide stakeholders with information regarding the quality of a company’s ESG practice. SEBI’s efforts to regulate ESG rating agencies in India is a step in the right direction. Future research in this domain should focus on the concerns related to heterogeneity in the ESG rating methodologies. Additionally, empirical research may focus on the impact of ESG ratings on investor preferences in the Indian context. – Shouvik Kumar Guha & Sourav Paul Credit Rating ESG Securities Regulation"

            "ITC-J&J Deal: Unravelling the Complexities of NCLAT’s Decision in the Merger Control Regime By GuestSeptember 5, 202311 Min readAdd comment   [Aryan Birewar, Rishabh Guha, and Dhanshitha Ravi are 4th Year BBA LLB (Hons.) students at Symbiosis Law School, Pune]  On 27 April 2023, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (“NCLAT”) passed an Order (“the Order”) favouring ITC Pvt. Ltd., reversing the penalty that was levied on it by the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) for not notifying a combination under section 43A of the Competition Act, 2002 (“the Act”). This was pertaining to ITC’s acquisition of trademarks and related assets of Johnson and Johnson’s (“J&J Pvt. Ltd.”) ‘Savlon’ (hereinafter, Transaction I) and ‘Shower to Shower’ (hereinafter, Transaction II), through two separate trademark purchase agreements dated 12 February 2015. This post examines the reasons as well as implications of NCLAT’s decision to reverse the penalty levied by the CCI. This includes a breakdown of how trademark assignment is classified for the purposes of Combinations and also analyses the scope of Item 3, Schedule I of the Combination Regulations, 2011, vis-a-vis trademark assignments. Finally, it delves into whether retrospective application can be afforded to the MCA Notification of 2017 and the implications of the same. Contextualizing Trademark Assignments under Merger Control  A Combination, for the purpose of section 5 of the Act, is limited to the acquisition of one or more enterprises by one or more persons. An ‘Enterprise’, in turn, is defined under section 2(h) as any person or governmental department engaged in the activity of storage, production, or distribution of articles, goods, or services. The CCI order dated 11 December 2017 held that trademark assignments fall within the ambit of ‘transfer of assets’ under the Act.  This holding stems from the scope of acquisition, given under section 2(a)(i) of the Act, i.e., acquisitions include the acquisition of shares, voting rights, and assets of the enterprise. The characterization of ‘assets’ found under Explanation to section 5(c) includes registered trademarks, GIs, copyrights, patents, etc.  By reading section 2(a)(i) with the Explanation to section 5(c), the CCI concluded that the purchase of the trademarks resulted in the purchase of the assets of J&J Pvt. Ltd., thereby constituting an ‘Acquisition of Enterprise’.  Furthermore, a reading of section 2(a)(ii), which brings ‘Control over Assets’ also within the meaning of ‘Acquisition’ for the purposes of combinations, further solidifies the intent of bringing trademarks under the realm of combinations. Even the European Commission in Otto/Primondo Assets (2010), categorically held that contractual purchase of intangible assets like trademarks, copyrights, domain names, etc. constitutes ‘Assets’ for the purposes of Article 3(1)(b) of EU Merger Regulation, 2004. This flows from the logical deduction that the trademarks are economic value-carrying assets, which will generate revenue for the assignee company. Drawing this to the Indian regime, the CCI in United Spirits, as early as 2013, approved the combination involving a trademark assignment along with technical know-how, undertaking a subjective evaluation of the potential effects of competition. Hence, this showcases the need for affording a purposive interpretation to section 5 of the Act. This is because any literal construction that excludes intangible assets could render the principle of merger control redundant, as rightly held by the CCI and upheld by the NCLAT order.  Validity of Exemption Claim under Combination Regulations   Schedule I of the Combination Regulations enlists types of acquisitions that lack the ability to cause an Appreciable Adverse Effect on Competition (“AAEC”) in the relevant market, thereby being exempted from the notification requirement. ITC Ltd. made a claim under Item 3 Schedule I of the Combination Regulations, 2011, which was rejected by the CCI in its entirety. This must be analysed in seriatim to decipher the rationality of the CCI’s stance, given that the NCLAT has only addressed the question of penalty imposition. The validity of the said claim rests upon the satisfaction of the following criteria: (i) Acquisition must not be directly related to the business of the acquiring party or (ii) Acquisition in the ordinary course of business (“OCB”), not leading to control over the enterprise whose assets are acquired.  Firstly, it is important to ascertain what constitutes a ‘direct relation’ to the business of an enterprise. There are two ways to determine the same. One being the substitutability test, evaluated in accordance with the relevant product market of the goods or services in question. This creates a strict segmentation, granting blanket protection from the notification requirement since, strictly speaking, ITC is neither involved in the production of handwashes nor prickly heat powder that automatically allows it to avail the exemption. On the other hand, the second approach  (preferred approach) offers a liberal connotation to ‘direct relation’, which is based on the principle that an acquirer naturally acquires enterprises having ‘overlapping product lines.’ This line of reasoning was adopted by the CCI in Schneider Electric and Larsen Toubro (2019), wherein it held that even though some of the target entity’s products were not substitutable, they can still be grouped as “overlapping products under one or more clusters based on their choice as portfolio/cluster”. Thus, the decision of the CCI to conclude that the trademark assignments were ‘directly related’ to the business of the acquirer in terms of falling under ‘personal care products’ is justified, rendering it ineligible to claim this exemption. Secondly, whether the acquisition of such a trademark qualifies as a transaction done in the OCB would require reference to the Telecom Spectrum Case, wherein the CCI delineated OCB as “frequent, routine, and usual revenue transactions”. The said Transactions I & II were short-term and did not affect the operating capacity of the enterprise as ITC was not in the business of purchase or sale of registered trademarks. Thus, this substantiates the reasoning followed by the CCI to disallow ITC from claiming this exemption as well. Thirdly, the condition regarding ‘control’ over the enterprise creates a precarious situation while examining it from the perspective of trademark assignment. Explanation (a) to section 5 of the Act categorically defines ‘control’ as controlling the management or affairs of the company. The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2023 has amended the interpretation of ‘control’ to include the exercise of ‘material influence’ over the commercial and strategic decisions of the target company.  Therefore, the primary question is whether the trademark assignment catapults in the exercise of material influence by the acquirer over the target company.    Surprisingly, neither the CCI nor the NCLAT addressed the implications of trademark assignment on the acquirer-target entity equation. But if we undertake a conjoint reading of Section 2(1)(b) and 37 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 it can be argued that trademark assignments solely transfer ownership rights and goodwill with respect to the mark.  The test of control, as per section 5 of the Act, requires the acquirer to be able to dictate commercial decisions of the target entity. Since trademark assignments do not affect the decision-making capacity of the target entity, the test of control enshrined in section 5 of the Act remains unsatisfied. Though if read separately, such a ‘control’ requirement would open a pandora’s box in terms of enabling all such trademark assignments from benefiting this exemption, the same cannot be exploited since the OCB requirement goes hand in hand with the ‘control requirement’, making it harder to claim such an exemption. Even in the present case, though purchasing the trademarks of Savlon and Shower does not lead to ‘control’, the OCB requirement is still not satisfied. Hence, the failure to satisfy the statutory criteria renders ITC Ltd. unable to claim the exemption benefit under Item 3, Schedule I of the Combination Regulations, 2011. Affording Retrospectivity to the De Minimis Threshold The De Minimis threshold set by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) Notification dated 4 March 2016 exempted combinations from notifying CCI if the assets and turnover with the transferor company fall below Rs. 350 crores and Rs. 1,000 crores, respectively. A clarificatory notification dated 27 March 2017 was issued to clarify that the assets and turnover of the portion of the target entity being acquired will only be relevant for the purpose of the exemption, as opposed to the previous regime that considered the entire assets and turnover the acquirer as well as acquired parties. Given the trademark assignments, in the present case, took place on 12 February 2015, the question of retrospectivity is significant to claim the exemption. NCLAT’s decision of choosing to afford the retrospective application of the MCA’s clarification is justified and attributable to the contemporary approach adopted by courts in interpreting such notifications, as opposed to the CCI, which blindly categorised it as a ‘substantive change’ and held the contrary. The NCLAT’s decisions can be rooted in the following trends in interpretation:   Absence of Wording in the Clarification: The CCI took the stand that the MCA clarification did not ‘explicitly’ provide for retrospective applicability explicitly. But this can be countered by the rationale laid in the case of Mithilesh Kumari v. Prem Behari Khare, wherein the Supreme Court held that the absence of a specific wording does not oust the possibility of retrospective applicability.  Precedence to Legislative Intent: In the case of JP Bansal v. State of Rajasthan, the Supreme Court held that courts must provide consideration to object-based reading of the law to understand the reasons behind the enactment. As seen in the case of Eli Lilly White & Co. v. CCI, NCLAT held the legislative intent behind De Minimis Exemption to incentivize ‘Ease of Doing Business’ and lessen the administrative burden of CCI. In the present case, retrospectively applying the exemption will only provide the said benefits to increasing number of combinations.  Test of Detriment: The retrospective applicability must not lead to benefit to one to the detriment of the other party. In the case of Commissioner of Income Tax, New Delhi v. Vatika Township, the Supreme Court held that any clarificatory amendment that confers certain benefits on some parties without inflicting harm on others must be applied retrospectively. In the present case, by approving combinations passing the required threshold, the economic and administrative objective of De Minimis Exemption is being met without any other party being adversely affected, considering that even parties on whom the penalty was levied can approach the court to get it reversed.  Hence, the NCLAT rightly held the exemption to be retrospectively applicable, and CCI’s rigid stance with respect to disallowing retrospective application is outdated. Conclusion and Suggestions Though it was right on the part of NCLAT to have reversed the penalty imposed by the CCI, there is still much ambiguity caused by NCLAT refraining from commenting upon certain crucial aspects regarding IPR assignments. For instance, it was important for it to have commented upon the method to deal with trademark assignments considering the exemptions under Item 1 Schedule 3, specifically the ‘lack of control over enterprise’ requirement. Even though this provision specifies that the acquisition of assets that represent “substantial business operations” (irrespective of whether such assets are organised as a separate legal entity or not) are disallowed from availing the exemption, there is still a lot of ambiguity in this regard since even the Competition Amendment Act, 2023 introduces this term, it does not define the same. This must be done as soon as possible since trademark assignments such as the present case require such contextualization. Furthermore, with regards to affording retrospective applicability, one cannot deny the floodgates argument, which will be inevitable for cases in which CCI had imposed a penalty for notification based on entire assets and turnover. An evident example would be the SRF-DuPont deal, wherein the CCI levied a penalty of Rs. 10 lakhs without considering the portion of the business of Du Pont (only pharmaceutical propellants) being acquired and considered the entire asset/turnover. Even if companies decide to approach the NCLAT to reverse the order of penalty, it must be noted that the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2023, requires the Appellant to deposit 25% of the penalty amount to file an appeal. This creates a financial impediment that inhibits companies from approaching the NCLAT. Thus, even though the reversal of penalty is warranted in the present case, this landmark judgment has conclusively ruled regarding the classification of IPRs as assets. However, it falls short of addressing the substantive questions concerning the intersection of IPR assignments and combination with respect to availment of the notification exemption. – Aryan Birewar, Rishabh Guha, and Dhanshitha Ravi Competition Act Competition Law Intellectual Property"

            "Company’s Interest vs Duty to Protect the Environment – A Director’s Balancing Act By GuestSeptember 5, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Abhijnan Jha is a partner and Urvashi Misra is a senior associate at AZB & Partners, New Delhi] In April 2022, António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, drew the world’s attention to the alarming findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its third report. Concerned that major emitters were not taking requisite steps to fulfil their climate pledges, the Secretary-General warned that unless governments everywhere reassess their energy policies, the world would soon be uninhabitable. Evidently, governments are responsible for framing and implementing policies for environmental conservation. However, large corporations controlling crucial sectors such as energy, minerals, and mining, hold the key to effectively reduce dependence on carbon fuels. Corporations act through a board of directors and such boards, especially in these sectors, find themselves under increasing scrutiny for taking affirmative steps towards protection of the environment. In February 2023, ClientEarth, an environmental law charity, filed a derivative claim against the directors of Shell Plc (“Shell”), the oil and gas giant, before the High Court in London. ClientEarth claimed that, while formulating Shell’s climate change risk management strategy, Shell’s directors had breached their directorial duty to promote Shell’s success as well as their duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence. Interestingly, ClientEarth’s grievance was not that the directors failed to take steps to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. It acknowledged Shell’s graded plan to eliminate carbon intensity of its products by 2050. However, ClientEarth argued that Shell’s directors were not acting fast enough as they had excluded short to medium-term targets to cut absolute emissions. In May 2023, the High Court dismissed ClientEarth’s application. On 12 July 2023, ClientEarth has once again approached the High Court to reconsider its dismissal. However, this request was also declined.   While ClientEarth’s action may not have been successful, it raises interesting questions on the obligations and liability of directors in the context of protection of the environment. Specifically, we consider, in the Indian context, whether (a) commercial decisions taken by directors for the company can be challenged when they appear to be at the cost of the environment; and (b) refuge, if any, is provided by the ‘business judgment rule’ to directors facing such a challenge.    Statutory Framework under the Companies Act, 2013 (“Indian Companies Act”) In India, the changing approach towards environment conservation is evident from section 166 of the Indian Companies Act which imposes a statutory duty upon directors to protect the environment [section 166(2)]. Prior to this change, a director’s fiduciary duty was limited to protecting and acting in the company’s best interests. The Indian Companies Act, while continuing to impose this directorial obligation to act in the best interests of the company, its employees and the shareholders, now also requires director to act “for the protection of environment” [section 166(2)]. The expansion of the ambit of a director’s duties in India was discussed by the Supreme Court in Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. vs. Cyrus Investments (P) Ltd. [(2021) 9 SCC 449] (“Tata Mistry Case”). The Court observed that “the history of evolution of the corporate world shows that it has moved from the: (i) familial to (ii) contractual and managerial to (iii) a regime of social accountability and responsibility. This is why Section 166(2) also talks about the duty of a Director to protect environment, in addition to his duties to: (i) promote the objects of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole; and (ii) act in the best interests of the company, its employees, the shareholders and the community”. [paragraph 19.23] It is pertinent, however, that the term ‘environment’ is not defined under the Indian Companies Act. The Supreme Court in M.K. Ranjitsinh vs. Union of India [(2021) 15 SCC 1, paragraph 12] observed that the term has to be given the meaning assigned to it under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Section 2(a) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, defines the word ‘environment’ to include the “interrelationship which exists among and between water, air and land, and human beings, other living creatures, plants, micro-organisms and property”. Section 166(7) of the Indian Companies Act provides that a failure to comply with the duties set out in section 166(2), including the duty to safeguard the environment, would attract a fine which may extend to INR 5,00,000/- (approximately USD 6000) [section 166(7)]. More importantly, and in addition to a monetary penalty, if a company’s shareholders believe that the directors’ decision(s) appears to tip towards promoting profits at the cost of environmental conservation, such shareholders would arguably have the right under section 241 of the Indian Companies Act to approach the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) and contend that the company’s affairs are being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest. The NCLT has wide powers in actions of oppression and mismanagement, which includes powers to suspend the board of directors of a company during the pendency of the proceedings [Union of India, MCA vs. Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. 2018 SCCOnline NCLT 8537, paragraph 8].  Faced with such an action, the directors may consider claiming protection under the ‘business judgment rule’. Business Judgment Rule The business judgment rule is a widely recognized protection available to directors, when their commercial decisions are put to test before a court of law. The principle entails that while making a commercial decision on the company’s behalf, the board would have acted in good faith, on an informed basis and with the honest belief that the action is in the company’s best interests [Aronson vs. Lewis, 473 A.2d 805 (1984)]. In the absence of any evidence of abuse of discretion, courts would typically refrain from second-guessing the decision of a properly functioning board of directors, even if it may not have been the best decision in the company’s interests [Fisher vs. Cadman [2005] EWHC 377 (Ch)]. The origins of the business judgment rule can be traced to the courts in the United Kingdom. As early as 1742, the Court of Chancery in the Charitable Corporation against Sir Robert Sutton and about Fifty Others [(1742) 26 ER 642] opined that “The events do often times shew, that the proceedings or omissions of persons acting in this capacity are of evil tendency; yet it would by no means be just in a Judge to determine from events that have happened that they might be foreseen, because if so, nobody would accept the direction of corporate affairs”. Over time, this rule has been further developed and refined, particularly by the courts in Delaware, United States of America, making it an effective shield for directors who have acted in good faith while taking commercial decisions for the company.  The high standard for challenging a board’s decision was recently reaffirmed by the Delaware Court of Chancery in City of Coral Springs Police Officers’ Pension Plan vs. Jack Dorsey, Block, Inc., [C.A. No. 2022-0091-KSJM, judgment dated May 9, 2023] by holding that “…a board comprising of a majority of disinterested and independent directors is free to make a terrible business decision without any meaningful threat of liability, so long as the directors approve the action in good faith.” In ClientEarth’s legal action against Shell’s directors, the High Court inter alia referred to the business judgment rule while dismissing ClientEarth’s application. Particularly, the High Court agreed with “…the well-established principle that it is for directors themselves to determine (acting in good faith) how best to promote the success of a company for the benefit of its members as a whole” [paragraph 19]. As can be seen, the presumption survives only in favor of independent/disinterested directors who have acted in good faith and on an informed basis. The principle would not aid directors who fail to exercise their fiduciary duties, namely due care, loyalty and/or good faith and consciously disregard their directorial duties. In the Indian context, there have been a limited number of reported cases wherein this defense has been relied upon. However, a perusal of even these limited cases demonstrates that this rule is recognized by both adjudicating authorities such as the NCLT (as seen in Fidaali Moiz Mithiborwala vs. Majolica Properties (P.) Ltd., 2017 SCC OnLine NCLT 20894, wherein the NCLT opined that every decision of the NCLT must be tested on the fulcrum of the business judgment rule] as well as regulatory authorities such as the SEBI (as seen in Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund, Adjudication Order No. PM/NR/2021-22/12225-12233, 2021 SCC OnLine SEBI 839, where the SEBI acknowledged that the genesis of business judgment rule can be traced to a Court’s “…respect for corporate self-governance, as well as their dislike for second-guessing the business decisions of corporate directors and officers”). The question which arises is whether the business judgment rule can be an effective shield against allegations of breach of statutory directorial duties. Unfortunately, Indian case law does not shed light on this issue yet. We can, however, take guidance from the High Court’s position in the ClientEarth action. This action was premised on the purported violation by Shell’s directors of their statutory duties. Nonetheless, the High Court accepted the business judgment rule as a valid defense against the same. Foreign courts, especially in common law jurisdictions, have taken a firm view in favour of application of the business judgment rule. In this context, it will be interesting to see the approach of Indian courts given their history of activism in environmental matters and how Indian courts balance environmental activism with established principles of limited directorial liability. Conclusion  Since the Indian Companies Act came into force, the courts in India have not had the opportunity to consider any challenge to a board’s decision on the ground that the same is in violation of the director’s duty to protect the environment. As such, it remains to be seen the manner in which such a challenge would be analyzed by the Indian courts and the extent to which the business judgment rule would come to the aid of the directors facing such a challenge. Naturally, factors such as the diligence exercised by the board, vested interests, if any, of the directors, material considered by the board, the director’s independence, etc. would play a crucial role in determining the outcome of any such challenge. However, given the manner in which courts in the United Kingdom and the United States of America have dealt with such claims, particularly ClientEarth’s action, one can assume that the business judgment rule would be an important shield for directors facing prosecution. – Abhijnan Jha & Urvashi Misra Climate Change Companies Act Company Law Directors Environmental Law"

            "Rajasthan’s Gig Workers’ Legislation: Paving the Way for Transformation? By GuestSeptember 4, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Esha Rathi is a final year B.B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student at Jindal Global Law School.] Rajasthan has taken the lead as the first Indian state to regulate and support the burgeoning gig economy workforce through a comprehensive legal framework titled “Rajasthan Platform Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act, 2023” (Act), the Bill for which was brought before the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly on 21 July 2023 and passed on July 24 2023. Through its provisions, the Act aims to provide the concerned class of workers with crucial social security and essential benefits. Although the Code on Social Security 2022 recognizes gig and platform workers and seeks to extend benefits to them at a central level, its implementation is still in progress. In the interim, Rajasthan has taken a proactive step to address these issues on a state level, thereby setting a significant precedent for other Indian states. Functioning as a safety net for countless unemployed youth and even the elderly, the gig economy offers a low-cost, low-investment labour market. It tantalizingly promises subsistence and flexible work opportunities via platforms like Ola, Uber, Swiggy, Zomato, Amazon, Urban Company and more. These platforms often identify as tech aggregators, mediators, or facilitators, steadfastly avoiding the label of employers and treating their workers as partners or independent contractors, thereby evading accountability and responsibility. Even though many facets of employment, including mode of arrangements, payments, costs, fares, incentives, penalties, and market entry or exit, are frequently subject to rules resembling those found in formal job markets, the benefits associated with formal employment, such as stable working hours, decent work conditions, and substantial wages and social security, elude these workers. In this context, Rajasthan’s Act serves as a momentous legislation to gig workers, a growing segment of the workforce that operates outside traditional employer-employee relationships. Championing the Gig Workers’ Cause The Act encompasses two key players in the gig economy: aggregators that are digital intermediaries linking buyers and sellers, and primary employers that are individuals or organisations directly engaging platform-based gig workers for a particular task against payment. The Act defines gig workers as individuals who perform work and earn income outside traditional employer-employee structures or those who work under contractual arrangements with terms and conditions leading to fixed payment rates, including all piece-rate work. The Act introduces the Platform Based Gig Workers Welfare Cess, a monthly contribution from aggregators and primary employers. This welfare cess, ranging from 1% to 2% of the value of each transaction, as may be notified by the State Government, must be deposited by the fifth day of each calendar month which, alongside worker contributions, government grants, and donations, will pool into the Rajasthan Platform Based Gig Workers Social Security and Welfare Fund, a dedicated resource aimed at supporting the welfare and social security of registered gig workers. In addition to the obvious benefits provided by such welfare cess, an ancillary advantage is that the calculation of this cess will compel companies to relinquish control over transaction-level data, which will now reside in a government-controlled database, accessible also to workers. Companies have long resisted such transparency, whereby customers would receive an upfront price, while the worker remained unaware of the actual amount and, consequently, had no insight into the effective commission rate imposed on that transaction. The Act also ensures comprehensive social security benefits, including accident and health insurance, maternity benefits, gratuity, pension, scholarships, and more, in line with existing schemes. The Act also empowers registered gig workers to raise concerns regarding their entitlements, payments, and other benefits through a dedicated grievance redressal mechanism, and establishes rigorous penalties for contravening the provisions of the Act. Violations by aggregators could lead to fines of up to Rs. 50 lakh, while principal employers might face fines up to Rs. 2 lakh for contraventions. To facilitate the aforesaid provisions, the Act mandates the establishment of the Rajasthan Platform Based Gig Workers Welfare Board, comprising government officials, worker representatives, aggregators, and civil society members. The aggregators and primary employees are mandated to register with this Board and submit comprehensive data about all platform-based gig workers engaged by them within 60 days of the Act’s implementation. Furthermore, every gig worker already onboarded or registered with a platform must also be registered with the Board. This registration, bestowed with a Unique ID, remains valid indefinitely, irrespective of engagement duration. In turn of such registration, this Board is entrusted with the discharge of several critical responsibilities, including registering gig workers, aggregators, and primary employers within the state, integrating welfare cess deductions into platforms’ mechanisms, devising social security schemes for registered workers, ensuring accessibility to benefits, and engaging with unions to facilitate transparent consultations. To further ensure accountability and transparency, all platform transactions will be tracked through the Central Transaction Information and Management System. This system, overseen by the Board, will monitor aspects like commission, GST deductions, and welfare cess collection, enhancing regulatory control and data accuracy. Redefining the Employer-Employee Relationship: A Missed Opportunity?  The primary shortcoming of the Act arises from the definitions assigned to gig workers and aggregators within the Act, which do not categorize gig workers as employees or aggregators as employers. There is a growing global consensus that many gig workers indeed fit within the broad definitions of employees and should be entitled to all the protections provided to traditional employees. However, Rajasthan’s Act sidesteps this issue by continuing to categorise the gig companies as aggregators. When gig workers are not officially recognized as employees, it raises the question of the extent to which aggregators can be held accountable. While some Indian platforms may include provisions for situations such as workplace accidents and resulting medical expenses, this approach risks transforming essential entitlements like occupational safety into acts of goodwill rather than legally mandated obligations. Consequently, the Act suffers from a narrow scope, failing to incorporate existing labour laws into its purposive framework of protecting gig workers. This oversight allows for the persistence of long-standing practices of non-compliance with labour regulations and a circumvention of responsibilities regarding workplace entitlements and protections. This is despite the high degree of control exerted over these workers, a point underscored in various jurisdictions that have classified gig workers as employees to afford employee-level benefits and protections, including Australia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Spain. Furthermore, Australia and New Zealand have shifted their terminological focus from ‘employer’ and ‘employee’ to ‘person conducting a business or undertaking’ and ‘worker in their workplace’, thereby emphasizing the duty of businesses to ensure worker health and safety, amongst other benefits, regardless of the employment status, traditional or otherwise. While this represents an aspirational model for the labour landscape, India would face significant challenges in striving towards such a paradigm shift through a single leap. In order to approach this vision, Rajasthan’s Act has the potential to take an incremental step towards bridging the gap between traditional and non-traditional workers, by categorizing gig workers as employees, which the Act does not provide for at present. However, it is essential to acknowledge that in countries where workers have been equated to employees or have been offered high benefits, gig platforms have faced increased costs, leading to reduced job availability or cessation of operations. Therefore, developing countries with substantial presence of informal employment, such as India, Indonesia, and Thailand, have remained silent on gig worker employment status, as the risk of misclassifying gig workers is high and could prove extremely costly for workers and consumers. In this context, India appears to adopt a cautious approach, providing ad hoc targeted measures for more visible groups of informal workers. Nevertheless, maintaining gig workers as independent contractors with piecemeal benefits fails to plug gaps in current labour laws and social protection schemes, particularly in countries like India, which do not have an effective universal social safety net. This regulatory approach also risks introducing a multitude of fragmented measures, adding administrative burdens for both workers and companies. Considering these challenges, India may benefit from introducing a third worker category, providing a more promising policy option that maintains worker autonomy while offering enhanced protections commensurate with the degree of control and dependence that the worker is under. Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, and certain other countries have implemented similar categories to encompass non-formal employment relationships and ensure entitlements to an appropriate level of rights and protections. Until such changes are introduced, the existing form of this legislation, designed to safeguard non-traditional workers, can act as a catalyst for discussions about expanding the category of workers entitled to the gamut of labour law protections. Concluding Thoughts  The platform-based gig worker engagement model has traditionally offered aggregators a business structure with low liability from a legal compliance perspective. In a refreshing departure from this norm, Rajasthan’s legislation for gig sector workers marks the beginning of a new era in India’s labour landscape. By addressing the distinct needs of gig workers, who often operate under non-traditional employment terms, and extending them social security benefits, the state not only acknowledges the evolving nature of work but also works toward fostering a more robust and inclusive economy. The gig economy holds significant potential for economic empowerment, but its realization depends on ensuring that workers are granted adequate rights and legal protections, and that aggregators fulfil their roles and responsibilities. While it is important to create an environment that supports gig workers, solely focusing on their needs may inadvertently burden aggregators and hinder their business operations. Hence, it is imperative to not only extend benefits to gig workers but also facilitate the growth of aggregator businesses. This balanced approach is essential to ensure the sustainability of the gig economy, which many depend on. To fully harness the potential of this legislation and shape the trajectory of the gig economy in India and beyond, it is imperative that Rajasthan effectively implements the provisions of the Act while simultaneously refining them through the Rules under the Act. – Esha Rathi Employment Law"

        "read_on_content": [
            "Supreme Court Holds Maternity Benefits Could Extend Even Beyond Contractual Term  By GuestSeptember 4, 20236 Min readAdd comment   [Lavanya Chawla is an Associate at J-Law Offices, New Delhi.] A three Judge bench of the Supreme Court in Dr. Kavita Yadav v The Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Department & Ors (17 August 2023) held that if a woman has worked in an establishment for 80 days, she would be eligible for full maternity benefits, even if such benefits exceed the term of contract. Facts An employee, Dr. Kavita, was appointed as Sr. Resident (Pathology) in Janakpuri Super Speciality Hospital w.e.f. 12 June 2014 for one year, “extendable on yearly basis upto a maximum of three years”. The employee’s service was extended on annual basis twice. Prior to expiry of the last term of one year i.e. before 11 June 2017, the employee became pregnant. On 24 May 2017, the employee applied for maternity leave commencing from 1 June 2017, under the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961 (“MBA”). On 9 June 2017, her employer informed her that since her contractual term is ending on 11 June 2017, she could avail only 11 days of maternity benefits. Further, the employer informed her that no further extension of contractual employment was permissible under the applicable rules. The Central Administrative Tribunal, New Delhi (“CAT”) and the Delhi High Court (in a writ petition challenging the decision of the CAT, New Delhi) rejected the contention of the employee. The Delhi High Court observed that the purpose of MBA is not to extend the period of contract, to enable her to avail maternity benefits under the MBA. The Delhi High Court held that the use of the expression “actual absence” in section 5(1) of the MBA presupposes that but for the maternity leave the woman employee would be expected to remain “present”. Once the contractual employment comes to an end, there would be no question of the woman employee remaining “absent” since she would not be expected to remain “present” following the determination of her contractual employment. Judgement of the Supreme Court The principal question before the Supreme Court was whether maternity benefits under the MBA “…would apply to a lady employee appointed on contract if the period for which she claims such benefits overshoots the contractual period”. (per paragraph 2 of the judgment) The Supreme Court observed as under:  The MBA provides for an embargo on the employer from “dismissing or discharging a woman who absents herself from work in accordance with the provisions of the Act during her absence. This embargo has been imposed under Section 12(2)(a) of the Act. The expression “discharge” is of wide import and it would include “discharge on conclusion of the contractual period”.   [Author’s note: It appears that reference to section12(2)(a) above should be read as reference to section12(1), as section 12(2)(a) only applies to entitlement to maternity benefits in the event of discharge or dismissal “anytime during the pregnancy, whereas it is section 12(1) that actually places an embargo on discharge during absence”.]  The Supreme Court held that once an employee is entitled to maternity benefits under section 5(2) of the MBA (i.e. completed 80 days of employment), “such benefits can travel beyond the term of employment also. It is not co-­terminus with the employment tenure”. (per paragraph 6 of the judgment) The Supreme Court relied on its earlier judgment in respect of women employees on muster roll with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (“MCD”), an elected local body at Delhi and held that women employees’ “tenure also stood notionally extended so far as application of maternity benefits” under the MBA. The Supreme Court also referred to its previous judgment in relation to entitlement of Union Government employees under CCS (Leave Rules), 1971 and, based on the ratio of the referenced judgments and in the light of section 27 of the MBA, it held that section 27 of the MBA, “gives overriding effect to the statute on any award, agreement or contract of service”.  Essentially, the Supreme Court held that once an employee fulfils the eligible criteria for availing maternity benefits (i.e. completes 80 days of employment), “she would be eligible for full maternity benefits even if such benefits exceed the duration of her contract.” (at paragraph 10) Author’s Comments The above case deals with a peculiar situation where a woman had started availing maternity benefits during the term of her employment, but her employment ended before she could avail the full benefits under the MBA. In light of these facts, the judgement of the Supreme Court, allowing the woman to avail maternity benefits for the residual term, appears to be just and fair considering the provisions of law and the genuine expectations of modern working women. However, the observation of the Court that the word “discharge” under section 12(2)(a) includes even “discharge on conclusion of contract period” potentially extends the impact of above judgement to cases where term of contract had expired and the woman had not even started availing maternity benefits. Section 12(2)(a) says that a woman will be entitled to maternity benefits if she is discharged or dismissed “at any time during her pregnancy”. If the line followed by Supreme Court is adopted, a woman employee would be entitled to avail maternity benefits even in cases where her term of employment has ended much before commencement of maternity benefits. This ambiguity is further compounded by the Court’s observation that a woman will be entitled to full maternity benefits once she has fulfilled the entitlement criteria specified in section 5(2) (i.e., 80 day employment). In our view, the judgment of the Supreme Court would lead to unintended difficulty in implementation as it is common, especially in the private sector, that employees are taken on short term contracts (be it six months or one year) for particular projects that then expire in due course. If the expression “discharge” under section12(2)(a) is interpreted to include “expiry of term of contract”, an employer would be forced to give maternity benefits to a woman employee even though her contract period has expired prior to commencement of maternity benefit period.    We believe the purpose of the Supreme Court was to extend a beneficial legislation to the fullest possible extent, thereby giving benefit to female employees; however, the particular interpretation attributed by the Supreme Court to the provisions of MBA may lead to unexpected implementational issues. – Lavanya Chawla Employment Law Interpretation of statutes"

            "Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: ICAI and CCI at Loggerheads over CPE Program By GuestSeptember 4, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Shruti Srivastava is a fourth-year law student from National Law University and Judicial Academy, Assam]  Delegated legislation is a vital framework that allows specialized bodies like the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) to regulate their respective professions effectively. As a statutory body, the ICAI derives its regulatory authority from the Chartered Accountants Act 1949 (CA Act, 1949). This Act confers upon the ICAI the power to maintain professional standards, ethics, and competencies within the accounting and auditing profession. The legislation also allows the ICAI to issue guidelines, rules, and regulations that govern various aspects of the profession, including continuing professional education, code of ethics, audit practices, and disciplinary proceedings. The Competition Commission of India (CCI), through an order dated 28 February 2014, directed the Director General to initiate an investigation into the Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Program administered by the ICAI. This decision resulted in a tussle between two regulatory bodies with legislative authority under delegated legislation. However, the Delhi High Court in Institute of Chartered Accountants of India v. Competition Commission of India declared the order issued by the CCI under section 26(1) of the Competition Act, 2002 invalid. ICAI’s CPE Program: Balancing Professional Development and Competition The petitioner, ICAI, had developed the CPE program, which imposed an obligation on its members to actively engage in educational activities about their profession to stay abreast of professional advancements and to enhance their skills. However, in 2013, the second respondent (Informant) filed a complaint under section 19(1) of the Competition Act, 2002 asserting that only the ICAI and its affiliates were authorized to conduct structured learning activities, thereby creating an exclusionary practice in the market. Therefore the ICAI’s conduct contravened section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002. The ICAI asserted that it operates as a non-profit organization and that the design of the CPE falls within the ambit of its powers as specified by the CA Act, 1949. Consequently, it argued that the CCI lacks jurisdiction to intervene in the matter. The informant agreed that since the ICAI is affiliated with the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), it is obligated to adhere to IFAC’s best practices, which include implementing a continuing professional development programme to ensure that its members regularly update their knowledge. However, the informant had a grievance with the policy that only the ICAI and its organs are allowed to conduct the CPE program’. He was of the view that “the ICAI is abusing its dominant position as a regulator to create a monopoly in the service of providing CPE seminars and therefore violating Sec. 4(1) of the Competition Act.” The informant wanted ICAI to outsource its function of running the CPE so that other market players could also participate in the market. The CCI was of the view that though the ICAI carries out regulatory functions under the CA Act, 1949 some of its activities are also commercial or economic. Concerning these commercial and economic functions, ICAI can be regarded as an enterprise within section 2(h) of the Competition Act, 2002. Therefore, CCI concluded that there is “force in the allegations of the informant that the restrictions put in by ICAI in not allowing any other organization to conduct the CPE seminars for CPE credits created an entry barrier for other players in the relevant market.”  Unraveling Jurisdictional Overlaps: Echoes of the Past This is not the first instance in which a jurisdictional overlap has occurred; there have been a significant number of such cases. In Shri Neeraj Malhotra v. North Delhi Power Limited and Others, the electricity distribution company faced allegations of engaging in antitrust activities. According to the Electricity Act 2003, the regulation of electricity tariff was designated to be within the purview of the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC), while the investigation of anti-competitive practices fell under the jurisdiction of the CCI. Furthermore, section 60 of the Electricity Act conferred upon the DERC the authority to issue directives in instances where an abuse of dominant position within the electricity industry has transpired. The Electricity Act’s language resulted in a state of confusion and an absence of definitiveness. In addition to this, the regulatory spat between the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) brought to light the conflicting perspectives regarding the regulation of Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs). In this case, SEBI contended that ULIP, being a hybrid product involving investment components and insurance components, should fall within its regulatory ambit, whereas the IRDA maintained that SEBI lacks jurisdiction over ULIP and it also rejected the idea of dual regulation. Further conundrum involving SEBI and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) also highlighted the complex interplay between regarding the recovery of funds and the imposition of a moratorium. The conflict arose from SEBI’s authority to seize the assets of the corporate debtor and the moratorium provisions established by the IBC, which explicitly prohibit such actions during the moratorium period. This raised important questions about the hierarchy and the determination of which non-obstante provision should take precedence whether it is the SEBI Act or the IBC. These clashes underscore the need for a comprehensive framework to define the roles and functions of cross-sector regulators like the CCI. There is a need to demarcate the functions and roles of these bodies clearly. Failure to establish clear boundaries and guidelines for such regulators could potentially result in future disputes like the SEBI-IRDA ULIP controversy. Thus, the Government needs to address this issue and ensure effective coordination and delineation of regulatory authority to prevent further complications and regulatory overlaps. Navigating Legal Territory: High Court Recognizes ICAI’s CPE Program The Delhi High Court emphasized the significance of recognizing the ICAI as a statutory body established under the CA Act, 1949. In this context, it asserted that the ICAI’s formulation of the CPE aimed at maintaining professional standards should not be deemed as an abuse of the dominant position. This conclusion aligns with the authority granted to the ICAI under section 30(k) of the CA Act, 1949, which empowers the institute, with prior approval and publication by the Central Government, to establish rules regulating and maintaining the professional qualifications of its members. It can be further elucidated that decisions concerning regulatory powers fall within the purview of the regulatory body and are subject to review only following the provisions stipulated in the governing statute. The nature of regulatory powers does not warrant scrutiny or review by the CCI. It is important to acknowledge that the CCI exercises its powers under the Competition Act, which, as delineated in Section 62 of that legislation, is in addition and not in derogation of other statutes. In Director of Income Tax (Exemptions) v. Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Delhi High Court held that the activities of the ICAI fall within the scope of charitable purposes as defined under section 2(15) of the Income Tax Act 1961. The primary objective of the ICAI is to regulate the profession of accountancy, and the activities involved in conducting educational programs cannot be classified as business or commercial activities in legal terms. A similar issue arose in Thupili Raveendra Babu v Bar Council of India, where it was determined that the Bar Council of India, as a statutory body defined under section 4 of the Advocates Act 1961, is not an enterprise under section 2(h) of the Competition Act, as it sets standards for legal education. Based on these considerations, the High Court concluded that “ICAI is a statutory body and charged with taking the necessary powers to take decisions regarding the conduct of the CPE program for enrolling as a chartered accountant as well as for maintaining the standards of the profession; its decisions in this regard cannot be a subject matter of review by the CCI. Such decisions do not operate in any market of trade or commerce. Such decisions do not operate in any market of trade and commerce.” Conclusion The concept of delegated legislation strikes a delicate balance between granting autonomy to specialized bodies and safeguarding the public interest. While delegated legislation empowers bodies like the ICAI to regulate their profession, it is essential to ensure that their actions do not impede competition or violate the principles of fair play. Oversight bodies like the CCI play a critical role in monitoring these specialized bodies to ensure that their regulatory activities align with the overall objective of protecting the public interest. When examining the boundaries of delegated legislation, it is crucial to consider the legislative intent behind granting regulatory powers to specialized bodies. Legislative intent defines the scope and limitations within which these bodies can operate. Any interference or allegations against such bodies should be evaluated against this legislative intent. The CCI does not have the authority to mandate a statutory body to outsource functions related to its statutory duties, even if those functions are considered economic activities. It would be incorrect to assume that simply because an activity falls under the definition of economic activity; it automatically necessitates the creation of an open market for that activity. Therefore, the CCI cannot enforce the outsourcing of activities by an organization or enterprise. The Court’s verdict in favor of the ICAI suggests that the CCI’s allegations overstepped the boundaries of delegated legislation. This reaffirms the significance of respecting the autonomy and regulatory authority granted to specialized bodies within the framework of delegated legislation. – Shruti Srivastava Accounting Competition Law Regulation"

            "An Exercise in Smoke and Mirrors: Imposing a “Goods” Tax on Actionable Claims By GuestSeptember 3, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Anushka PS is a third-year student pursuing the BA/LLB (Hons.) course from the National Law School of India University, Bangalore] The imposition of tax in the gaming industry is an issue that has long plagued both stakeholders and academics alike. With the Parliament tabling an amendment to the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (the ‘CGST Act’) to precipitate the levy of 28% goods and services tax (GST) on online real money games, concerns regarding its incidence have only been aggravated. Of particular importance is the decision to tax the “face values” of the amounts paid by users, as against solely the platform fees or the gross gaming revenue. Such “face value” has two primary components – a fee collected for platform use, that is, the platform fee, and an amount pooled into an escrow amount, which forms part of the prize money in the case of real money games. The prize money is transferred to the winner of the real money game. Consequently, the latter has been deemed an “actionable claim” by the Bombay High Court in Gurdeep Singh Sachar and by the Karnataka High Court in Gameskraft Technologies owing to it conferring a right upon players to claim prize money upon winning. The Problem Such characterization of prize money as an actionable claim raises a pertinent issue. The judiciary has repeatedlydistinguished “actionable claims” from “goods” in cases involving the applicability of goods tax statutes. Article 336(12) of the Constitution of India circumscribes the definition of “goods” to “materials, commodities and articles” and any tax statute positing a definition foraying beyond this is immediately arraigned as being unconstitutional (see H Anraj, Sunrise Associates or Skill Lotto). Even the CGST Act adhered to this scheme until recently. Schedule III of the CGST Act specifically excluded actionable claims from the purview of supply and, consequently, of taxation. Yet, the forthcoming amendment seeks to conflate actionable claims with goods by introducing “specific actionable claims” within the scope of supply. Further, such claims have been purported to include online money gaming vide the newly introduced clause 102A. In this post, I argue that the Indian judiciary has consistently excluded actionable claims from the constitutional definition of goods. I further argue that even if prize money as an actionable claim could potentially be included within the definition of goods, the imposition of GST solely on the prize money in online gaming as against all actionable claims generally, is susceptible to constitutional claims on account of hostile discrimination and violation of Article 14. Actionable Claims are Rights, Not Concrete Goods Section 2(1) of the CGST Act confers upon actionable claims the same definition assigned to it by section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act. According to section 3, an actionable claim essentially means a claim to an unsecured debt or a beneficial interest in movable property not in the claimant’s possession which civil courts utilized as affording grounds for relief to the claimant. In H Anraj, the Supreme Court held that a lottery ticket was an actionable claim on account of it being “a right to a prize upon the payment of a price.” The issue in this case was whether Article 246(3), which conferred upon states the power to tax the sale of goods, could be applied to the sale of lottery tickets. While the Court ultimately decided in the affirmative, it did so by adopting a convoluted strategy of splitting the lottery ticket into two components – a saleable element and an actionable claim. While the former was liable to taxation, the latter was conclusively declared exempt from it. This was because the definition of goods in Article 366(12) did not comprehend inchoate claims to property. A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court in Sunrise Associates reaffirmed this finding. However, it found that the sale of lottery tickets would be susceptible to taxation. This was because an actionable claim when sold and purchased “like a good” attained a different quality, so as to fall under Article 366(12)’s inclusive definition of a good. Here, it is pertinent to note that the Court did not undermine its interpretation of an actionable claim as referring to a “right.” It merely utilized a functional definition of a good – that which was treated like a good would be taxed as one. This judgement’s inclusion of actionable claims within Article 366(12) is therefore restricted to instances where actionable claims are themselves being sold and purchased like goods with intrinsic value. Similarly, courts have held various other rights in movable property to be actionable claims. In Bharti Airtel, recharge vouchers were declared actionable claims since they created a “right to receive telephone services.” Courts have also termed actionable claims rights to arrears of rent, to provident funds, to reward points earned by customers under loyalty programmes, to profits from profit-sharing agreements and so on. The Restricted Scope of Taxable Claims under the CGST Act Prize money involved in lottery, gambling and betting games has been taxed under the erstwhile CGST Act due to their specific inclusion within “goods” as mentioned in section 2(52) read with Schedule III Entry 6. In Teesta Distributors, the Calcutta High Court allowed the imposition of GST on the prize money collected by a lottery gaming platform. The Court sanguinely relied upon the legal framework outlined above to arrive at its conclusion without much reference to the constitutionality of such taxation. A constitutional challenge was instituted in Skill Lotto Solutions. Predictably, the petitioners’ arguments were three-fold: first, they contended based on established precedent that actionable claims were exempt from the constitutional definition of goods; second, they argued that the prize monies collected via lotteries, betting or gambling, being actionable claims were consequently exempt from GST; and third, they argued that the selective imposition of GST on prize money collected from these three activities to the exclusion of others was an exercise in hostile discrimination and violative of Article 14. In response to these contentions, the three-judge bench interpreted Sunrise Associates in an overly-broad manner to hold that all actionable claims were included within Article 366(12)’s “goods”. Simply put, the bench ignored the limited functional test applied in Sunrise Associates. Thereby, it concluded that section 2(52) and Entry 6 of Schedule III were not unconstitutional.  With regards to the Article 14 contention, the Court observed that the Government could make reasonable classifications in furtherance of a legitimate aim – the legitimate aim here being the need to combat gaming addiction and interest in curbing acts that undermined public policy.  The existence and judicial affirmative of various gambling legislation indicate the legitimacy of such objectives. The decision in Skill Lotto has also served to justify the continued imposition of a 28% GST on gambling activities. The Court’s reasoning leaves no doubt that the legitimate objective extends only to gambling which retains the propensity to cause social issues. Further, in recent cases like Gameskraft, Gurdeep Singh Sachar, Varun Gumbar and Ravindra Singh Chaudhary, the High Courts have categorically stated that actionable claims in games of skill are still excluded from the scope of GST.  Nevertheless, the GST Council has still relied upon Skill Lotto to propose taxation on actionable claims in all online games involving prize money. The proposed amendment sought to be made to the CGST Act is further predicated upon these recommendations. This highlights the sharp inconsistency and confusion pervading the field. Misinterpretation and overreliance seem to be the norm. The Constitutional Shortcomings of the Proposed Amendment As illustrated above, the amendment seeks to include “specific actionable claims” (including prize money from online gaming, lotteries, betting, horse racing, casinos and gambling) within the scope of supply so as to attract GST of 28%.  This amendment is susceptible to a constitutional challenge similar to the one instituted in Skill Lotto – the classification between specific actionable claims and other general actionable claims seems hostile, discriminatory and violative of Article 14, given its detrimental impact on online real money games (by resulting in double taxation, emboldening illegal sites, and even impacting MeitY’s efforts at boosting the online gaming industry via its Guidelines). There seems to be no stated legitimate objective to this classification. Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has observed that a uniform tax on all components of the amounts paid by players would “increase transparency” in an opaque field. Yet others speculate that the tax is intended at taxing international players who play from outside India and players who use digital forms of consideration like cryptocurrency and so on. However, justifications have not been provided for these reasons and there seems to be no cogent reason to treat online gaming on par with its gambling counterparts. Therefore, it is evident that this amendment results in a scenario prone to constitutional challenge. Further, the entire amendment seems to be predicated solely upon an erroneous interpretation of the judgment in Sunrise Associates. Additionally, the established jurisprudence on the exclusion of actionable claims from the constitutional definition of goods has been disregarded. Conclusion This post has sought to accomplish three objectives: first, it has demonstrated that the judiciary has consistently distinguished actionable claims as defined by section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act from “goods” as defined in Article 366(12) of the Constitution. Second, it has shown that lotteries and other gambling activities, despite being actionable claims, have been taxed under the GST due to the presence of a legitimate state objective justifying such taxation. Third, it has argued that the proposed amendment to the CGST Act intending to extend the application of CGST to actionable claims collected by all online gaming services, is susceptible to claims of Article 14 violations, given the lack of a legitimate objective buttressing it. In all, given the amendment’s faulty legal basis, the challenge is likely to be weighty. – Anushka PS Taxation"

        "read_on_content": [
            "Decoding “Ordinary Course of Business” in M&A Transactions By GuestAugust 29, 202310 Min readAdd comment   [Rajat Sethi is a Partner and Oorja Chari an Associate at S&R Associates] In common parlance, transactions entered in the “ordinary course of business” include transactions carried out in the day-to-day course of business to further the company’s business, in line with its charter documents. Black’s Law Dictionary defines ordinary course of business as “normal routine in managing trade or business”. The Law Dictionary defines the phrase as “those activities that are necessary and normal”. Despite frequent usage of the phrase in numerous legislations and mergers and acquisitions agreements (“M&A Agreements”), its interpretation remains a matter of debate. An assessment of whether a transaction is in the ordinary course of business can differ on a case-to-case basis. Ordinary Course of Business under the Companies Act, 2013 The Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) uses the term “ordinary course of business” in the context of provision of financial assistance (section 67) and related party transactions (sections 185, 188 and 189). Section 67(2) of the Act prohibits financial assistance by a public company to any person in connection with a purchase or subscription of its shares.  Section 67(3) of the Act carves out an exception in respect of the lending of money by a banking company in the ordinary course of its business. Section 185(1) of the Act states that a company cannot advance any loan, guarantee or security to any director of a company, or of a company which is its holding company or any partner or relative of any such director or to any firm in which any such director or relative is a partner. There is an exemption, subject to certain conditions, for a company which in the ordinary course of its business provides loans or gives guarantees or securities for the due repayment of any loan. Section 188(1) of the Act provides that a company shall not require the approval of the board of directors for entering into a transaction or arrangement with a related party provided that such transaction is in the ordinary course of business and on an arm’s length basis. Section 189(1) of the Act mandates companies to maintain particulars of all contracts or arrangements entered into by interested directors or with related parties. This does not apply to any contract or arrangement by a banking company for the collection of bills in the ordinary course of its business. Ordinary Course in Acquisition Agreements The expression “ordinary course of business” is ubiquitous in M&A Agreements. M&A Agreements regulate the behavior of target companies in the following manner between signing and closing:  Conduct of business in the ordinary course: M&A Agreements typically envisage an affirmative covenant where a seller agrees that in the period between signing and closing, the target company will carry out its business in the ordinary course. Requiring consent of the buyer for certain actions outside the ordinary course: M&A Agreements will typically mandate that prior written consent of the buyer be obtained for the target company to undertake specified actions that are not in its ordinary course of business between signing and closing.  In addition, M&A Agreements will include a warranty that after a particular date (defined as the Accounts Date, which would be the date after which audited or reviewed accounts are not available), the target company has conducted its business in the ordinary course. The rationale behind such provisions is to ensure that once definitive agreements are executed following completion of due diligence and on the basis of an agreed valuation, the buyer substantially receives what it has bargained for. An important remedy in relation to the breach of an ordinary course covenant often resides in the conditions precedent and the termination sections of an acquisition agreement. As a condition precedent to closing, M&A Agreements will require that the seller has duly performed certain covenants, agreements, obligations and undertakings required to be performed under this agreement in material respects. These obligations will include adhering to the ordinary course covenant. Thus, a failure of the target to comply with the ordinary course of business covenant may allow the buyer to refuse to close the transaction or terminate the acquisition agreement if that option, subject to any cure rights, has been envisaged. Indian Case Law Indian case law interpreting the expression “ordinary course of business” has tended to be in the context of taxation statutes.  Certain key principles that emerge from such case law are set out below. Charter documents are not sufficient Indian courts have consistently held that the mere fact that an activity was one of the objects enumerated in the memorandum of association is not sufficient for such activity to be considered as being in the ordinary business of the company. In Seksaria Biswan Sugar Factory Limited v. Commissioner of Income Tax, the Bombay High Court held that every act done intra vires of the company is not necessarily done in the course of business. The Court observed: “It must be found as to whether the particular act has any connection with the normal business that the company is carrying on and whether it is so related to the business of the company that it can be considered to be performed in the ordinary course of the business of that company.” Frequency of the activity In Bharti Televentures Limited vs Addl./Jt. Commissioner of Income Tax, the Delhi High Court affirmed that the memorandum and articles of association of the company are not conclusive on the question whether activities of a company amount to carrying on of business, but sufficiently show the intention of the assessee to pursue certain main objects. The Court highlighted the importance of the frequency of the activity as such frequency gives rise to a continuous and organized activity. The Court further expressed the view that everything associated or connected with the business cannot be said to be incidental to it. Proximity of the activity to the business is not sufficient, but the activity should be an integral part of the business. Continuity of a transaction over a course of time in the business of the company is an important factor in considering whether an action is in the ordinary course of business. In Somanath Baraman v. Raja S. V. Jagannatha Rao, the Andhra Pradesh High Court held that “stray or casual act cannot be called an act done in the ordinary course of business”. The Court noted that a “habit system” and continuity is required to satisfy the test of regular or ordinary course of business. Contribution to business In Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax v. Oscar Investments Limited 2006 98 ITD 339 Mum, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai Bench reiterated that the objects clause of the memorandum of association of a company is not conclusive for determining the nature of activity as a substantial part of business as it only enables the company to carry out activities specified therein. The pattern or trend of capital employed, utilization of assets and composition of income over a period of years and not merely of one year shall be factors influencing the determination of an activity which is a substantial as a part of business. The tribunal observed that significance and contribution of each activity would play a crucial role in deciding whether the business carried on by the company is in ordinary course and a substantial part thereof, even if such contribution is a negative income. The tribunal further observed that any person carrying on business activity in the ordinary course should have a reasonable knowledge of applicable statutory obligations relevant to such activity. The applicability of regulatory framework to the activities of the company and compliance therewith is an essential factor to determine the nature of activity, i.e., whether such activity is an activity carried on in the ordinary course of business or is an incidental business activity. Undistinguished common flow of business The Supreme Court recently held in Anuj Jain Interim Resolution Professional for Jaypee Infratech Limited v Axis Bank Limited, in the context of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, that “even when furnishing a security may be one of normal business practices, it would become a part of ‘ordinary course of business’ of a particular corporate entity only if it falls in place as part of ‘the undistinguished common flow of business done’; and is not arising out of ‘any special or particular situation’.” UK Case Law In Koza Ltd v Akcil [2019] EWCA Civ 891, the meaning of “ordinary course of business” was considered by the Court of Appeal. Interestingly, the Court observed that it does not follow from the fact that a particular activity will benefit the company that it will be in the ordinary course of the company’s business. An unprecedented new venture for a company, though deemed beneficial, would not necessarily be in the ordinary course. Thus, it is necessary to examine the existing business of the company, and decide whether, in the light of all the circumstances prevailing at the time when the activity is embarked on, it can properly be described, objectively, as within the ordinary course. This judgement highlights that any expenditure targeted at protecting and furthering the core business, notwithstanding that it is unprecedented, can be construed in a particular case to be in the ordinary course of business. In Michael Wilson & Partners, Ltd v Emmott [2015] EWCA Civ 1028, the Court of Appeal observed that what amounts to payments or disposals in the ordinary course of business is a highly fact-sensitive question. It was noted what is in the ordinary and proper course of business depends on what business is carried on by the company, and how it is carried on. A payment which might be made in the ordinary and proper course of one business may not satisfy that description in the case of a different business. Likewise, a payment which might be made in the ordinary and proper course of a business carried on in one location, may not satisfy that description in the case of the same kind of business carried on in a different location. The Court further observed that it is not helpful to substitute the phrase “ordinary course of business” with synonyms like “routine” or “recurring”. A transaction which is neither of those may also be regarded as being in the “ordinary course of business”. Examples of Activities Falling Outside the Ordinary Course of Business The International Standard on Auditing (ISA) 550 – Related Parties has listed examples of transactions that may be considered outside a company’s normal course of business:  Complex equity transactions, such as corporate restructurings or acquisitions. Transactions with offshore entities in jurisdictions with weak corporate laws. The leasing of premises or the rendering of management services by the entity to another party if no consideration is exchanged. Sales transactions with unusually large discounts or returns. Transactions with circular arrangements, for example, sales with a commitment to repurchase. Transactions under contracts whose terms are changed before expiry.  This list should be considered illustrative and is subject to further analysis of specific fact situations. Conclusion A guidance note on related party transactions published by the Institute of Company Secretaries of India provides a helpful summary of relevant factors to consider whether an activity has carried on by the business is in the ‘ordinary course of business’:  Whether the activity is covered in the objects clause of the memorandum of association; Whether the activity is in furtherance of the business; Whether the activity is normal or otherwise routine for the particular business (i.e. activities like advertising, staff training, etc.); Whether the activity is repetitive/frequent; Whether the income, if any, earned from such activity/transaction is treated as business income in the company’s books of account; Whether the transactions are common in the particular industry; Whether there is any historical practice to conduct such activities; The financial scale of the activity with regard to the operations of the business; Revenue generated by the activity; and Resources committed to the activity.  – Rajat Sethi & Oorja Chari Mergers and Acquisitions"

            "Mediation Dreams, Legislative Realities: Analysing the Mediation Bill, 2023 By GuestAugust 28, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Akarshi Narain and Gayatri Kondapalli are 3rd-year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) students at NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad] Mediation, as a mode of alternative dispute resolution, has increasingly been gaining traction in the international sphere. The Singapore Convention on Mediation, adopted in 2018, envisages cross-border enforcement of settlement agreements similar to that of arbitral awards under the New York Convention. India was one of the first countries to become a signatory to this Convention. In line with these developments, the government introduced the Mediation Bill in 2021, which was recently passed by the Rajya Sabha. This legislation is an attempt to promote mediation in the country while simultaneously relieving the judiciary of its heavy caseload. It is also a step towards the overarching aim of making India an alternative dispute resolution hub. However, the authors argue that the proposed legislation falls short of achieving this primary objective. In pursuance of this, three major drawbacks of the Bill are discussed, which would hinder the alignment of this legislation with its aspiration. Limited Scope of the Bill While the Government’s move to specifically enact a legislation to develop mediation is praise-worthy, a fundamental factor for the success of this endeavour is the scope of the Bill. It is argued that this scope is constrained with respect to both pre- and post-mediation stages. Firstly, the Bill does not allow cross-border enforcement of settlement agreements, as envisaged under the Singapore Convention. Settlement agreements from mediations conducted outside India do not fall within the scope of the Mediation Bill, 2023. Furthermore, settlement agreements in India would be treated as a judgement or decree of the court. The Singapore Convention, under Article 7, expressly excludes such settlement agreements from its ambit. Hence, not only would international settlement agreements concluded outside India lack direct enforceability in the country, but also all domestic and international mediations conducted in India would not be covered within the ambit of the Singapore Convention. This highly jeopardises any chances of India becoming an international mediation hub. The Indian Government has defended its decision by stating that it has no such obligation because it has not yet ratified the Singapore Convention. The Government also commented that provisions for enforcement of such international settlement agreements, in line with the Singapore Convention, would be enacted only when the Convention gains international acceptance. However, it is argued that the country is missing out on a golden opportunity. Until date, only 11 countries have ratified this Convention, among which the only commercial hub is Singapore. Hence, establishing the legal framework for the enforcement of international settlement agreements would give India a head-start. This would further the Bill’s overall purpose of making India a mediation hub. Secondly, under clause 3(f) of the Bill, the definition of international mediation is limited to just commercial mediation. However, mediation is most commonly undertaken for civil matters such as divorce or custody. Therefore, as also suggested in the Parliamentary Standing Committee report, the Bill would benefit by expanding its scope to cover civil matters as well in international mediations. Lastly, the list of matters declared unfit for mediation, under Annexure 1 of the Bill, is unnecessarily long. Commonly, such matters pertain to criminal law, competition law, and public policy issues. However, Annexure 1 also includes topics like tax and property. Excluding such a multitude of issues from the legislation’s ambit is counterproductive to the overall objective of promoting mediation. Hence, when a broad overview of the Bill is undertaken, it is evident that the scope of the Bill is more constrained than it should have been. Decoding the Debate Behind Mandatory Mediation The second drawback deals with the mandatory pre-litigation mediation clause in the Mediation Bill, 2021. It was accused of violating principles of consent and was removed after public criticism. However, strong arguments exist for a mandatory pre-litigation mediation regime in India. For instance, mandatory mediation would translate into greater mediated disputes than a voluntary mediation regime. This reduces judicial burden, creates employment opportunities for professionals, and a culture of amicable dispute settlement. While not instant, this post suggests that India should gradually incorporate a country-specific mandatory mediation model. At the same time, it becomes important to first address certain concerns that have surrounded the debate on mandatory mediation. One common argument against mandatory mediation is that it vitiates the voluntary ethos of mediation. However, this claim requires closer scrutiny. To clear a common misconception, mandatory mediation does not mean forcing parties to settle disputes via mediation. Rather, it mandates parties to attempt mediation for dispute settlement, giving them the freedom to litigate if mediation fails. There exists party autonomy to enter litigation after a specified number of mediation sessions or to agree on a settlement. So, the fundamental right to access justice remains intact. Furthermore, voluntariness remains a foundational element in this opt-out model of mandatory mediation. Compelling reluctant parties to attempt mediation has been perceived as another shortcoming. However, given the low public awareness regarding mediation in India, the initial inertia to attempt mediation can be overcome by a compulsory process. Multiple studies have highlighted that mediation with a compulsory flavour plays a more significant role as a means of effective dispute resolution, than when it is merely voluntary. The authors argue that mandatory mediation needs to be implemented in a phased manner suited to the Indian context. In M.R. Krishna Murthi v. The New India Insurance Co. Ltd., the Supreme Court supported a phased introduction of mandatory mediation, proposing to start with a limited category of cases. The NITI Aayog, too, had recommended a similar scheme recently. In furtherance of this, a study can be undertaken to determine the disputes most amenable to being resolved via mediation. Any attempt to make mediation mandatory would gain greater validity if it took an evidence-based approach. A relevant example in this regard is Italy, which introduced mandatory mediation in 2013 with a four-year sunset clause, following which the law had to be reviewed. Thus, mandatory mediation can start with a small pilot programme and gradually be modified based on demonstrated defects that are discovered. Lastly, the legislative intent behind this provision is to majorly decongest the judiciary and enhance the ease of doing business. Mandatory proceedings would go a longer way in achieving this aim. That being said, mandatory mediation would not work in the absence of qualified personnel. This merits examining the Mediation Council and the provisions surrounding mediators in the Act. Problems Concerning the Mediation Council and Mediating Professionals The Bill envisages creation of the Mediation Council of India that would regulate the registration of mediators, and recognise mediation service providers and institutes. Evidently, the Council along with the mediating professionals would play a decisive role in determining the success of the legislation. However, several lacunae exist regarding the Council and the mediators. The Mediation Council lacks adequate representation of experienced practitioners. This is unlike most professional regulators such as the Bar Council of India. The importance of experience cannot be discounted especially at this nascent stage of mediation in India, when finding feasible solutions to novel issues would be a challenge. Additionally, the Council requires prior approval from the Central Government before issuing regulations related to its essential functions, raising concerns about partisanship and independence. Greater murkiness would arise in situations where the Government itself is a party to the mediation. Effective mediation is centred around a skilled mediator. However, no uniform regulation has been devised for the accreditation of mediators. Nor does the Bill provide for qualifications required to be a trained mediator. This can lead to a problem of ineffectual mediators, which would hamper the uptake of mediation, in turn, upending the Bill’s objective. A possible solution could be to frame a regulation on the uniform accreditation of mediators. This would give a fillip to mediators in India receiving international standard training and exposure. The Government can also tie up with private groups in line with the same. In the United Kingdom, for instance, a private institution, the Civil Mediation Council, provides voluntary training and practice standards for individuals and organisations. A regulatory body which lays down these standards and reviews the performance of existing mediators would also strengthen the mediation process. Besides, an influx of qualified professionals would give impetus to constructing the infrastructure required to deal with the number of cases compulsory mediation would entail (and vice versa). Conclusion Empirical evidence clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of mediation as a dispute resolution mechanism in India. The Bill aims to reap this efficacy and usher in a legal revolution by uplifting mediation as a parallel dispute resolution mechanism. While the Bill has incorporated recommendations by experts such as the Parliamentary Standing Committee, the stopgaps highlighted above must be plugged in for the legislation to reach its full potential. As such, the authors make a case for an expanded scope of the legislation, a phased introduction of mandatory mediation and, eventually, bridging the gap through a relook at the Mediation Council and the quality of mediators. Raising public awareness about mediation via training sessions, courses and webinars by experts would also go a long way in determining the legislation’s success. To conclude, apart from its effective implementation, the above-mentioned lacunae merit a relook into the Bill via suitable amendments in the near future. – Akarshi Narain & Gayatri Kondapalli Arbitration Civil Procedure Mediation"

            "Harmonious Dispute Resolution: Unveiling India’s Mediation Bill 2023 By GuestAugust 28, 20236 Min readAdd comment   [Esha Rathi is a final year B.B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student at Jindal Global Law School.] In a significant leap towards modernizing the legal framework and expediting the resolution of civil and commercial disputes, the Rajya Sabha recently passed the Mediation Bill 2023. This pioneering legislation marks a crucial shift, elevating mediation as the primary avenue for dispute resolution, prior to resorting to the often costly and protracted traditional court processes. As we delve into the provisions, implications, and challenges presented by the Mediation Bill 2023, it is imperative to explore its predecessor, the Mediation Bill 2021, and the evolving landscape of dispute resolution in India. Mediation Bill 2021: Paving the Path The introduction of the Mediation Bill 2021 in the Rajya Sabha aimed to institutionalize a dispute resolution mechanism founded on collaborative problem-solving and the preservation of relationships. This approach was poised to propel India towards a more harmonious and efficient dispute resolution process, ensuring timely justice delivery and amicable settlements. Central to the Bill was the mandate that all civil and commercial disputes must undergo mediation before entering the court arena. Parties were obligated to participate in a minimum of two mediation sessions, underscoring the significance of exhausting alternative remedies before resorting to litigation. A time-bound approach dictated the completion of the mediation process within 180 days from the initial mediator meeting, with a provision for extension of another 180 days through mutual agreement. Finally, the creation of the Mediation Council of India was a pivotal proposal of the Bill, which was tasked with accrediting mediators and establishing a mediator pool, and overseeing the quality and training of mediators. The Bill traversed the corridors of the Indian legislative framework, ultimately reaching the scrutiny of the Standing Committee. Comprising experts armed with technical expertise, the Committee meticulously examined the Bill’s provisions and raised pertinent concerns. A focal point of contention centred on the coercive nature of mandatory pre-litigation mediation. While promoting out-of-court settlements, the element of compulsion raised questions regarding the principles of free consent, the voluntary nature of mediation, and the potential burden of failed mediation attempts on the judicial system. Enter Mediation Bill 2023: An Evolved Paradigm?  The emergence of the Mediation Bill 2023 builds upon the foundation established by its precursor, presenting substantial changes that address nuanced aspects of mediation. Court-annexed mediation remains a pivotal component, offering services either free of charge or at minimal cost. Moreover, the Bill ushers in the prospect of a robust private mediation sector through institutional mediation, wherein service providers extend mediation via their designated panel of mediators. Parties gain the autonomy to select a mediator best aligned with their case, in exchange for professional fees. The core tenets of mediation, i.e., confidentiality, self-determination, and voluntariness, are safeguarded within the Bill. The Bill affords protection against admissibility and privilege against disclosure, confidentiality of mediation communication, and non-disclosure of the cause of non-settlement in reports by the mediator. The definition of mediation requires that a mediated settlement is the outcome of self-determination; pre-litigation mediation is now voluntary and any party can, at any point in the mediation, also opt out of the process.   Adapting to the digital age, mediation proceedings have been extended to the online realm, amplifying participation convenience and expanding the process’s accessibility. This change also aligns seamlessly with the overarching goal of enhancing cost-effectiveness within the sphere of justice. In a marked departure from its predecessor, the Bill revises the time limit for completing mediation to 120 days, with an additional 60-day extension, effectively curtailing the overall mediation duration from 360 to 180 days. Navigating Future Horizons While the Mediation Bill 2023 presents transformative potential, some of the critical considerations that warrant attention are as follows. The competence of the Mediation Council emerges as a pivotal factor. While a mandatory member with expertise in mediation law remains fundamental, comprehensive proficiency is indispensable to uphold the core principles of mediation. Owing to the lack of a regularized process of admitting individuals in the Mediation Council and the Government’s involvement in approving the panel, the potential influence of the Government over the Mediation Council, especially in cases where the Government is a party itself, must be addressed to ensure autonomy and skill-based leadership. The Bill introduces dual categories of mediators, i.e., registered and unregistered, expanding the mediator pool. However, caution is warranted as the Bill also provides for enforcement of a mediated settlement agreement (MSA) in a manner as if it were a judgment or decree passed by a court. Allowing mediated settlement agreements to be enforced as court judgments may lead to misuse, particularly for weaker parties facing power imbalances. To mitigate this risk, confining enforcement to MSAs mediated by registered practitioners could serve as a prudent safeguard. Significantly, the Bill lacks provisions for sanctions in the event of confidentiality breaches. This lacuna jeopardizes the provision of maintaining the confidentiality of mediation proceedings. Until provisions are enshrined that provide certainty regarding the consequences of breaching confidentiality, parties should consider entering into confidentiality agreements at the start of mediation. This would help instil confidence in parties involved in disputes concerning sensitive data, as it would offer protection against potential breaches through injunctive relief and damages to compensate for any losses caused by such breaches. Concluding Thoughts  So far, India has not had a dedicated standalone legislation pertaining to mediation and various statutes have incorporated provisions related to mediation. The Mediation Bill 2023 will thus significantly contribute to the formalization and advancement of mediation procedures within the country. The Bill, by elevating MSAs to a binding and enforceable status upon endorsement by the parties and mediator, holds the potential to unclog courts, ameliorating the influx of fresh disputes and addressing extant ones. The incorporation of voluntary pre-litigation mediation underscores a pragmatic approach, rooted in the consent-driven essence of mediation that does not force parties to go through the rigmarole of mandatory mediation with unwillingness or lack of faith in the process. Although the voluntary application of provisions of the Bill does not appear to serve the legislative intent of the Bill with which it was sought to be enacted, the mandatory provision rests in dormancy, poised for activation as mediator capacity escalates and favourable mediation experience serves as the most compelling enticement for litigants to embrace this alternative dispute resolution mechanism, allowing for a paradigm shift in its due time and natural course. As India journeys toward a more harmonious dispute resolution era, the Bill stands as a beacon, illuminating a path towards efficacious and equitable resolution. – Esha Rathi Arbitration Civil Procedure Mediation"

            "‘Enabling’ Provisions of PMLA: Casting a Net Too Wide? By GuestAugust 20, 20237 Min readAdd comment   [Bhamini Tanwani and Vanshika Manglani are fourth-year B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) students at Hidayatullah National Law University, Raipur] The High Court of Delhi (‘the Court’) in case of PayPal Payments Private Limited v. Financial Intelligence Unit Indiaheld that payment platform PayPal is included in the definition of ‘payment system operator’ under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (‘PMLA’) and is therefore liable to comply with the reporting obligations as per rule 3 of the Prevention of Money Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005 (‘the Rules’). However, the Court held that imposition of penalty was not justified as PayPal was under a bona-fide belief of not having been covered by the provisions of PMLA. In this post, the authors argue that the Court erred in categorizing PayPal as a ‘payment system operator’ and such an interpretation would have dire consequences, both for other payment gateways and the regulating authorities. The Dispute The petitioner, PayPal Payments Private Limited (‘PayPal’) was found to be a ‘payment system operator’ under section 2(1)(rb) of PMLA by the respondent, Financial Intelligence Unit India (‘FIU-IND’), which imposed monetary penalties for non-compliance with the reporting obligations. PayPal asserted that it cannot be categorized as a ‘payment system operator’ because it does not engage in ‘clearing, payment or provision of settlement between payer and beneficiary’. It is merely an ‘online payment gateway service provider’ as the transmission only takes place through authorized dealer banks and at no point does PayPal hold any funds. This argument finds basis in a stance taken by the Reserve Bank of India, which when posed with the question as to whether PayPal is a payment system operator under the Payment and Settlements System Act, 2007 (‘PSS Act’), responded in negative. It was also argued that it could not be forced to register as a reporting entity till requisite amendments are brought to PMLA which unequivocally cover such payment gateway systems.  On the other hand, FIU-IND asserted that PayPal squarely falls under the definition of ‘reporting entity’ under section 2(1)(wa) of the PMLA by virtue of it being a financial institution under Section 2(1)(l). It was contended that PSS Act and PMLA have diverse purposes. PSS Act is a financial regulatory statute whereas PMLA deals with laundering of money and financing of illicit activities. Therefore, despite the existence of identical definitions, an interpretation under one act cannot be used to settle questions that arise under the second act. It was also the case of FIU-IND that PayPal is presently acting in accordance with anti-money laundering statutes of several countries and cannot create an unjustifiable exception for its operations in India. Decision of the Court On the question of pari materia interpretation of the PSS Act, the Court sided with the respondents, holding that the mere fact that online payment gateway systems are not covered under the PSS Act, would not, by itself create a ground to exclude them from the PMLA. It also took note of the legislative intent and objectives of the PMLA, stating that each interpretation should be in line with the ethos of the PMLA and cannot be substituted with an interpretation under a different act. On PayPal’s status under the PMLA, the Court held that a payment system is one which ‘enables’ payment between payer and beneficiary and that the legislative intent was to regulate a wide spectrum of activities under the PMLA. Reliance was placed on the case of Rasila S. Mehta v. Custodian, Nariman Bhavan, holding that special statutes are to be interpreted in a manner that results in highest fulfilment of their objects. On the question of penalty as per the order, the Court relied on Hindustan Steel Ltd. vs. State of Orissa and quashed the penalty that was imposed by FIU-IND on the grounds that PayPal was under a bona-fide belief of not having been covered under the provisions of PMLA.  Is PayPal a Reporting Entity: An Analysis  The decision of the Court is instrumental in India’s fight against money-laundering and would also help increase the country’s ranking in the Financial Action Task Force (‘FATF’) ratings. It will have huge implications for all the players in the fin-tech sector. However, the authors believe that the court has missed the boat with regards to certain issues which deserved a well-rounded explanation. Wide Ambit of Payment System Operator The decision has left payment gateways and other regulators in the dark. There exists uncertainty around how the PMLA would regulate other payment gateways that offer similar technological platforms for money transfers but do not handle funds directly. The question that arises is that do other entities that carry out similar functions also qualify as payment system operators under section 2(1)(rc) if PayPal is to be considered a payment system operator? The court has given a broad interpretation to the term “enable” as used in section 2(1)(rb) to include every platform that is connected to the payment in some way or the other. Such an interpretation is not correct in light of the penal nature of certain provisions of PMLA. It is a well-settled principle that the penal provisions should be construed strictly. The same was substantiated in the case of Glaxo Laboratories Ltd. v. Presiding Officer, wherein the court held that the penal provisions must receive a strict construction. Further, in another case of Tolaram Relumal v. State of Bombay, the Supreme Court, while applying the aforementioned principle observed that a more liberal approach should be adopted while dealing with two possible constructions of a penal provision. Other Third-Party Apps Not Included The Court categorically excluded third party apps like GPay and Amazon Pay from the purview of a payment system operator. By doing so it created a distinction between two platforms which ‘enable’ payments. The court observed that these third-party apps are regulated by National Payments Corporation of India (‘NPCI’) and are a part of United Payments Interface (‘UPI’). In the view of the authors, this distinction is not correct because if the same interpretation is given to the word “enable” as adopted in the case of PayPal then both these platforms would also come within the purview of PMLA. Therefore, it is the contention of the authors that if PayPal is categorized as a ‘reporting entity’ then a clarification should be provided as to what the future holds for these third-party apps which constitute a major part of the financial transactions that take place in the country. Compliance Burden The reporting entities are required to make all the disclosures as prescribed under section 12 of the PMLA which includes maintaining and furnishing records of all transactions, among other things. Reporting entity is defined under section 2(1)(wa) to include a banking company, a financial institution, an intermediary or any person so designated. This definition covers authorized dealer banks which handle the funds. As a consequence, unnecessarily including PayPal would lead to duplication of efforts. Moreover, the question remains that even if these repetitive disclosures are allowed, does the state have the necessary infrastructure to process such a heavy amount of data? Therefore, it is argued by the authors that such compliance would be burdensome, not only for the disclosing entities, but also the state machinery that will have to process the same data multiple times. Conclusion and Way Forward The fintech sector in India is growing at a rapid pace and such growth calls for regulation of fintech companies. The judgment by the Court is one such attempt to include a fintech company i.e. PayPal under the ambit of a reporting entity under the PMLA. This move has caused a lot of uncertainty for other payment gateways and aggregators. Crypto-currency is currently not regulated by any agency and going by this interpretation of the definition, even entities dealing in crypto-currency would form part of ‘reporting entity’. The judgment has cast a wide net as to the ambit of a ‘payment system operator’ which demands urgent clarification.  Indeed, the Court has followed a balanced approach by disallowing the penalty imposed on PayPal for lack of mala-fide intention. However, there are certain key issues which the judgment missed and even though they seem small, can have dire consequences for the fin-tech sector in India. – Bhamini Tanwani & Vanshika Manglani Banking Financial Markets Money Laundering"

            "SC Ruling in Paschimanchal Vidyut: Analyzing the Treatment of Statutory Dues as Secured Credit By GuestAugust 15, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Rakshit Agarwal and Tarun Ashok are third-year B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student at the National Law School of India University, Bangalore] The recent judgment by a division bench of the Supreme Court of India in Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd v Raman Ispat Private Limited (‘PVVNL’) has, as we argue, settled the debate on whether statutory dues are to be considered as secured credit for the purposes of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (‘IBC’). This post will be divided into three parts. The first section lays down a summary of the facts in issue and the ratio of the Court in PVVNL. The second part provides a brief analysis of the current position of law dealing with the treatment of statutory credit. In the final section, we provide a demonstration of the manner in which the judgment clarifies the legal position surrounding this issue. At the outset however, an important caveat is that the scope of the post is limited to situations where the resolution plan has been approved by the Adjudicating Authority. We therefore seek to examine whether an approved resolution plan can be set aside for want of payment of statutory dues.   Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd v Raman Ispat Private Limited – An Analysis The appellants in this case entered into a contract for the supply of electricity with the respondents, with a condition that the outstanding dues would constitute a charge on the respondent’s assets. However, during the pendency of the contract in 2017, the respondents got admitted into CIRP. In 2018, the Collector issued a notice for the recovery of outstanding dues by an auction of the respondent’s property. This was set aside by the Adjudicating Authority, who also passed a liquidation order. The key issue is whether the Electricity Act 2003, under sections 173-174, which provides for an overriding effect in cases of inconsistencies with any other law including the IBC, would have priority on debt claims under the resolution plan. Taking cognizance of the hierarchy of dues under section 53 of the IBC, where government debts are not only distinguished from secured credit but are also accorded lower priority than unsecured credit, the Court noted that the statutory dues are to be treated as distinct and separate from secured credit. With respect to the arguments in support of the overriding effect of the Electricity Act, the Court noted that section 238 of the IBC has an overriding effect in general, which would prevail over the non-obstante clauses of the Electricity Act. Thus, the Court dismissed the appeal of the PVVNL that sought to obtain priority for the electricity dues. Before making analytical claims as to the suitability of such a decision, we will proceed to analyze the hierarchy of dues and the current position of law dealing with the treatment of government dues as secured credit. The Contemporary Treatment of Statutory Dues as Secured Credit  The general principle that has been laid down so far across a wide range of cases involving statutory dues is that the exclusion of their payment has been held to be valid where there is no overriding clause within the specific statute in question. This section will briefly highlight the jurisprudence surrounding the same. In Ghanshyam Mishra v Edelweiss Construction Company, a three judge bench of the Supreme Court relied on landmark cases such as K Sashidhar v Indian Overseas Bank, Arcelor Mittal v Satish Kumar Gupta and CIT v Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd to reinforce various crucial principles. First, the commercial wisdom of the Committee of Creditors is of paramount importance and judicial scrutiny of the Resolution Plan is restricted to the touchstones of sections 30(2) and 61(3) of the Code. Second, section 238 of the Code has an overriding effect over other laws in force. It arrived at this conclusion from judicial precedents as well as the Finance Minister’s speech in the Rajya Sabha debates on the 2019 IBC Amendment. Third, it clarified that once the resolution plan is approved by the Adjudicating Authority, all debts to the Central or State Government shall stand extinguished and the plan would have binding effect. The legislative rationale behind this is the ‘clean slate’ principle – that the resolution applicant should not be confronted with surprise claims that would jeopardize their plans and make them unviable post-resolution. The key takeaway from the court’s harmonious construction of sections 3(10) and section 5(20) and (21) was that a claim regarding statutory dues would fall under the ambit of operational credit/debt and would be dealt with according to the waterfall mechanism envisioned under section 53. It gives preferential treatment to secured credit over statutory dues, thus bringing out the distinction and the need for differential treatment between the two. Ghanshyam was relied on by the NCLAT in Damodar, which heard a challenge to the Resolution Plan for being violative of section 30(2)(e) of the IBC. The appellants submitted that the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission Regulations, 2013 had been contravened by the Resolution Plan, and therefore the plan was violative of the IBC. The regulation in question mandated the repayment of outstanding dues for the re-connection of electricity services. The court ruled against them, and cited Ghanshyam to postulate that all statutory dues would stand extinguished if excluded from the approved Resolution Plan. It held that a combined reading of various provisions of the IBC would make it abundantly clear that a Resolution Plan cannot contravene any law if a statutory provision was not overridden by section 238. However, it is clearly evident that section 238 would become redundant if all laws in force have to be followed while formulating the Resolution Plan. Therefore, it concluded that section 238 would have an overriding effect on the Statutory Regulations in the present case. While the treatment of statutory dues seems to be clear insofar as it is treated as operational credit, the position was complicated by the widely criticized judgment in State Tax Officer v Rainbow Papers, where the Supreme Court determined that the provision for a first charge under section 48 of the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act 2003 (GVAT’) was not inconsistent with section 53 of the IBC. It opined that the Government would constitute a secured creditor by virtue of the creation of a security interest in their favor through the operation of law through the GVAT Act, which gave them a first charge on the property.  It concluded that debts due to a secured creditor would rank equally with other debts including workmen’s dues according to section 53 (1)(b)(ii) of the Code. This decision deviates from established precedents mentioned above which treated statutory dues as operational debt. The complication in the legal position resulting from Rainbow Papers was remedied to an extent in the case of Jet Aircraft where there was a specific exclusion clause present under section 82 of the Maharashtra GST Act 2017 which provided the government a first charge on property, from which the operation of the IBC was exempted. The apex Court relied on this to hold that the state was to be treated as an operational creditor and was consequently not entitled to challenge the approval of the resolution plan. It differentiated Rainbow Papers by virtue of the statutory exemption granted to claims under the IBC and held that the same was confined to its factual situation. The question that came up for consideration in Sree Metaliks was similar to Jet Airways, insofar as there existed a savings clause in section 142A of the Customs Act excluding claims under various statutes including the IBC from a first charge on property. The court therefore differentiated the present case from Rainbow Papers using the rationale in Jet Airways, and relied on Ghanshyam Mishra to decide that the statutory dues would stand extinguished. Thus, an analysis of the established precedent above reflects a proposition that the non-presence of an overriding or non-obstante clause would result in statutory dues being treated as operational credit. The question that remains is whether tax statutes with non-obstante clauses that do not exempt the IBC from its operation, such as that in Rainbow Papers, would have an overriding effect over the resolution plan contemplated under the IBC. It is in these situations that PVVNL provides us with a clearer position of law, which we argue is good law. Significance of the Judgment The current judgment is a marked distinction from the principle laid down in Rainbow Papers, re-affirming the position that statutory credit is not secured credit and Rainbow Papers is limited to its facts alone. Fortunately, to bring in more clarity regarding the issue at hand, the Supreme Court has affirmed the principle that the IBC would prevail despite the presence of a non-obstante clause in another statute. This upholds the legislative intent behind the presence of an IBC as well as the previous dicta of the Court as outlined above. As a result of the judgment, it is now re-established that section 238 would prevail over non-obstante clauses as well. We will now proceed to expound on the importance and necessity of the same. First, the judgment does well in further setting aside the controversial ratio put forth in Rainbow Papers. In recognizing Rainbow Paper’s failure to acknowledge the design and intent of the waterfall mechanism envisaged under section 53 of the IBC, the Court affirms the differential treatment that ought to be granted to secured credit and statutory credit. As observed by the Court, the use of distinct terms to describe two different dues under section 53 means that they cannot be treated as one and the same. Further, it also emphasizes on the effect of section 238, which Rainbow Papers fails to account for. The judgment also recognizes the Parliamentary intent of giving primacy to section 238 over other inconsistent laws. Second, as already emphasized in Ghanshyam, the judgment merely strengthens and reinforces the ‘clean slate’ principle, which seeks to ensure that resolution applicants are not confronted with claims that jeopardize the resolution plan and alter its viability. This furthers the legislative intent, ensuring that the IBC fulfills its role as a public interest legislation to prevent hardships to insolvent entities. Furthermore, it ensures a smooth, hassle-friendly insolvency resolution process. Such a measure contributes to the ease of doing business within India as well. Conclusion In this post, we have examined the treatment of statutory credit as statutory dues and examined the recent judgment in Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd v Raman Ispat Private Limited. Having analyzed the judgment as well as the current position of law on this topic, we conclude that the judgment is good law that not only fulfills the purpose of the IBC but also furthers public interest. – Rakshit Agarwal and Tarun Ashok Company Law Insolvency"

            "A Re-Examination of the First Principles of Sections 28 and 37 of the Income Tax Act: Part II By GuestAugust 14, 202310 Min readAdd comment   [Rucha A Vaidya is an Advocate, Bombay High Court. The author would like to thank Mr. Mihir Naniwadekar, Advocate Bombay High Court, for his comments on the earlier draft of this post. Part I is available here] Having considered the facts and the judgments of Shah and Sundresh JJ in PCIT v. Prakash Chand Lunia in the earlier part, this post will analyse the underlying issue concerning sections 28 and 37 of the Act. The fundamental difference between section 28 and section 37 is that section 28 provides a mechanism to first arrive at the profits from the business/profession. Therefore, it becomes crucial to account for goods lost that do not form part of the business’s stock in trade and hence naturally are not a part of the stock in trade used in order to earn the profit. Therefore, these losses should be rightfully claimed under section 28. In other words, losses of a business are inherently within the scope of section 28: those losses simply fall on the business and therefore reduce the business profits. On the other hand, section 37 allows the expenditures which are expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business that are incurred for earning the profits to be reduced therefrom. It is in this context that the question of whether an expenditure is incidental or has a nexus with the profits of the business becomes relevant. Losses of stock/funds that form part of trade may or may not be connected as such with the running of the business. For example, theft is not in any manner connected with the natural course of conducting a business. However, not allowing the loss caused due to theft would be unreasonable since the goods lost due to theft ought to be reduced while calculating the profits that are earned from the goods sold in the business. In other words, when determining whether goods/funds lost can be allowed as a business loss, it must be seen whether such loss ‘belongs to the business’. It was in this context that in Badridas Daga v. CIT, the Supreme Court, dealing with whether bad debts caused due to misappropriation of an assessee’s funds engaged in a banking business fell under a business expense under section 10(2)(xv) or under a business loss under section 10(1)  of the Income Tax Act, 1922 (corresponding to sections 37 and  28 of the Act respectively), held that such bad debts are deemed to be incidental to the business since they occurred due to an act of the assessee’s employees and was as such connected to the assessee’s business. The words ‘incidental’ were used to tie a thread between the loss caused to the assessee in his business with the running of the business itself. Thus, the words ‘incidental’ / ‘connected to the business’ must be interpreted in a manner meaning ‘of / belonging to the business’. As a general principle, any loss that arises out of factors not strictly connected with the business cannot be denied to be reduced from the profits by applying a literal interpretation of the words ‘incidental to the business’ since such losses, by their very nature, do not arise in the normal course of the business. What is important is to see is whether the loss is a loss ‘of the business’. It is important to bear in mind that a loss is distinct from an expense – a loss simply falls where it does, and there is no ‘purpose’ for a loss. If a loss falls on the business, then the effect of that loss is to strip away the receipts of that business and thus automatically reduce the profits of that business. On the other hand, an ‘expenditure’ is incurred for certain purposes; hence, in dealing with expenditure, it becomes important to look at the purpose of that expenditure to see whether the expenditure was ‘wholly and exclusively for business purposes’. In Haji Aziz & Abdul Shakoor Bros v. CIT, the Supreme Court was dealing with the issue of whether the penalty paid for confiscation of dates would be deductible under section 10(2)(xv) of the Income Tax Act, 1922 (corresponding to section 37 of the Act). A penalty of such nature, by its very nature, is an expenditure that is incurred on account of an infraction of the law; in that sense, the penalty is not wholly and exclusively for the purposes of business. It was therefore held to not be allowed u/s 10(2)(xv) of the 1922 Act. On the other hand, PCIT v. Prakash Chand Lunia was concerned with the loss of confiscated silver bars and not with any penalty paid in order to redeem the confiscated goods. Confiscation of the goods itself cannot be equated with a penalty/fine paid for redeeming such goods. A confiscation is simply an event that causes a loss that falls on the assessee. The question of whether a loss is “wholly or exclusively” for the purposes of business does not arise. The only question is whether the loss is ‘of’ the business, in the sense that it is the loss that is suffered by the business. Therefore, the question remains whether the principles of section 37 can be extended to section 28 as the two sections operate on different functions. The conceptual distinction between a loss and an expense cannot be wished away. Therefore, the judgment of Haji Aziz seems to be of little relevance when dealing with a ‘loss’ case. Similarly, the judgment of the Bombay High Court in J.S Parkar v. V.B Palekar does not help much since the assessee was engaged in the business of transporting iced fishes, mangoes, and other goods by sea while the Central Excise authorities confiscated gold. Therefore, the confiscated goods, anyways, did not form part of the assessee’s business and were hence disallowed as a business loss. This can be explained on the basis that the loss did not fall on the business at all, as the gold was not a part of the stock of the business. Therefore, the decision in J S Parkar, when seen in the proper perspective of the facts in that case, is also factually distinct and does not throw any light on the controversy which really arose in Lunia. All in all, the decisions of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Soni Hinduji Kushalji & Co. v. CIT and that of the Supreme Court in Dr. T A Quereshi v. CIT are the ones more directly relevant to answer the controversy which arose in Lunia. The reasoning given by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Soni Hinduji undoubtedly merits detailed consideration. The Court stated: “what are chargeable to tax in respect of a business carried on by the assessee are the profits or gains of a particular assessment year. While assessing the profits, necessarily loss incurred in the business during the year should be taken into account, as otherwise it is not possible to arrive at the true profits earned by the assessee. It is well-settled that the taint of illegality associated with profits or income is immaterial for the purpose of taxation. Income-tax Acts are not necessarily restricted in their application to lawful business only. One who contravenes a statute and trades in business prohibited by law while being liable for prosecution for the offence committed by him will, at the same time, be liable to pay tax out of the income or profits earned from the illegal trade or business.”. However, it also states that the loss incurred by an assessee due to the confiscation of goods is not as a trader/ in the role of a trader, and therefore such loss could not be held to be a business/ commercial loss. At first glance, this seems to be a logical view to take. However, this raises the question of why one is to think of this loss as not being suffered by the business. The ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in Dr. T A Quereshi provides an answer to this question. The Andhra Pradesh decision was prior in point of time to TA Qureshi, so the Andhra Pradesh High Court did not have the benefit of the exposition of law by the Supreme Court on this point. In TA Qureshi, the Supreme Court does not merely follow its decision in Piara Singh but gives its own reasoning by observing- “15. In our opinion, the High Court has adopted an emotional and moral approach rather than a legal approach. We fully agree with the High Court that the assessee was committing a highly immoral act in illegally manufacturing and selling heroin. However, cases are to be decided by Court on legal principles and not on one’s own moral views. Law is different from morality, as the positivist jurists Bentham and Austin pointed out. 16. As already observed above, the facts of the case are squarely covered by the decision of this Court in Piara Singh’s case (supra). 17. The Explanation to section 37 has really nothing to do with the present case as it is not a case of a business expenditure, but of business loss. Business losses are allowable on ordinary commercial principles in computing profits. Once it is found that the heroin seized formed part of the stock-in-trade of the assessee, it follows that the seizure and confiscation of such stock-in-trade has to be allowed as a business loss. Loss of stock-in-trade has to be considered as a trading loss vide CIT v. S.N.A.S.A. Annamalai Chettiar AIR 1973 SC 1032.” Conclusion Thus, following the above observation by the Supreme Court, it can be said the purpose of the Income Tax Act 1961 is to enable an assessment and collection of tax. The allowance/disallowance of losses cannot be motivated by whether the same arises from an infraction of law or not. The Income Tax Act 1961 is not a penal statute. Action for violation of the law can be very well taken under penal statutes. Therefore, as long as a tax on the confiscated goods is collected, there should be no bar to allowing the confiscated goods as a business loss. There is no valid conceptual basis as to why the Explanation to section 37 (in the context of expenditures) ought to be applied to section 28 (in the different context of losses). In any event, the decision in Qureshi was binding on the coordinate Bench in Lunia; and the decision in Haji Aziz was on the issue of expenditures and not on losses. Considering all the cases referred to in Lunia, some of which are factually different and some of which discussed eligibility of expenditures u/s 37, it would seem that there are strong grounds for the decision in Lunia to be reconsidered (both as a matter of principle and on account of how it dealt with the precedent on the point, particularly TA Qureshi) and for the issue involved being referred to a larger bench of the Supreme Court.

            "A Re-Examination of the First Principles of Sections 28 and 37 of the Income Tax Act: Part I By GuestAugust 13, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Rucha A Vaidya is an Advocate, Bombay High Court. The author would like to thank Mr. Mihir Naniwadekar, Advocate Bombay High Court, for his comments on the earlier draft of this post] This is a two-part post on a judgment of the Supreme Court of India (SC) in PCIT v. Prakash Chand Lunia (24 April 2023), which provides an opportunity for closely examining some of the fundamental principles underlying the taxation of business profits under the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Act”). Part I of the post discusses the factual background and the judgments of M.R Shah and M.M Sundresh JJ. Part II dives into the analysis of the underlying fundamentals governing the operation of sections 28 and 37 of the Act pertaining to the claims for expenses or losses arising in the course of ‘illegal’ activities. The case involved a claim of trading loss on account of goods confiscated by Customs Authorities due to an infraction of the law. It raised issues on the scope of the Explanation to section 37 of the Act and the application of that Explanation to claims of loss made under section 28. The brief facts of the case were that the assessee was engaged in the business of purchase and sale of silver. A search was conducted at the business premises of the assessee, and slabs of silver and silver ingots were recovered by the Department of Revenue Intelligence (“DRI”). The Collector Customs ordered absolute confiscation of unaccounted slabs of silver on the ground that the silver confiscated was smuggled as no details for same were found in the assessee’s books of accounts. The assessee claimed that the loss on account of confiscation should be allowed as a trading loss incidental to the business. During the assessment, the Assessing Officer observed that the assessee could not explain the nature and source of acquisition of the said silver. Consequently, he passed an assessment order and made additions under section 69A. The Appellate Authorities upheld the additions made by the assessing officer. On appeal, the Rajasthan High Court held that when the value of silver was added to the assessee’s income, the loss by confiscation of the silver was required to be allowed as a business loss to the assessee. On an appeal by the revenue to the Supreme Court, the judges (Shah and Sundresh JJ.) hearing the appeal delivered two separate but concurring judgments, albeit with different reasonings. It would be convenient to first set out the contents of these sections. Section 28 of the Act deals with the mechanism to compute profits from business or profession. While computing such profits, a loss incurred during an assessee’s business is allowed to be reduced from the profits of the business. As per accounting principles, business loss is allowable in order to derive the true profits of the business or profession. On the other hand, sections 30 – 37 of the Act provide various deductions for expenditures to be deducted from the profits of the business. Sections 30-36 provide specific expenditures that are allowable as deductions. Section 37 is a residuary and general provision. Explanation 1 to section 37, inserted by the Finance Act 1998 with retrospective effect from 1 April 1962, states as under: “For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that any expenditure incurred by an assessee for any purpose which is an offence or which is prohibited by law shall not be deemed to have been incurred for the purpose of business or profession, and no deduction or allowance shall be made in respect of such expenditure.” The facts in the case of Lunia provided an opportunity for the Supreme Court to consider the application and scope of this Explanation. Judgment delivered by Shah J.  Shah J. held that the loss claimed by the assessee in the present case is not allowable as a business loss. Though he recognised that the assessee had claimed a business loss as opposed to a business expenditure, it was held that Explanation 1 to section 37 of the Act had a bearing on the business loss claimed due to the confiscation of the silver bars. Shah J. referred to the decisions of CIT v. Piara Singh relied upon by the assessee and Haji Aziz & Abdul Shakoor Bros v. CIT, Soni Hinduji Kushalji & Co. v. CIT  and J.S Parkar v. V.B Palekar relied upon by the revenue. He held that the fundamental difference in the facts of Piara Singh, on the one hand, and Haji Aziz, Soni Hinduji Kushalji, and J .S Parkar, on the other hand, was that in Piara Singh, the assessee was engaged in a smuggling business which was an illegal business while in the other three cases, the assesses were otherwise engaged in legitimate businesses. Therefore, in the case of Piara Singh, the confiscation was of smuggled goods which was a penal action for the illegal business carried on by the assessee, and since the assessee was anyways engaged in an illegal business, such loss on account of confiscated goods had a nexus with the business of the assessee. It could therefore be allowed as a business loss in the facts of that assessee. However, in the present case, the assessee was otherwise engaged in the legal business of dealing in silver, and the loss on account of confiscated silver bars had no nexus with the general conduct of the assessee’s business and is hence not allowable as a business loss. Therefore, the decision of the Supreme Court in Piara Singh was (according to Shah J.) inapplicable to the facts of the present case, while Haji Aziz, Soni Hinduji Kushalji, and J .S Parkar were applicable. Judgment delivered by Sundresh J.  The Judgment of Sundresh J. can be segregated into two segments: Obliteration of the Distinction Between Business Expenditure and Business Loss  Relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in Badridas Daga v. CIT, Sundresh J. held that there was a similarity in the test qua a ‘loss’ as laid down by the Supreme Court in Badridas Daga and ‘expenditure’ under section 37 of the Act. There was a distinction only in the accounting treatment of the two concepts. Thus, the phrase ‘any expenditure’ mentioned in section 37 of the Act took in its sweep ‘loss’ occasioned in the course of business, as well. Hence, the logic of disallowing expenditure under Explanation 1 to section 37 could also be extended to disallowing losses under s 28. Treatment of Precedents In support of the extension of Explanation 1 to section 37 to cover even business losses under section 28, the following decisions were relied on by Sundresh J.: – Badridas Daga, wherein it was held that a loss can be claimed if it arises out of and is incidental to the assessee’s business. A claim for deduction of a loss is allowable so long as it emanated directly from the carrying on of the business, being incidental to it. In other words, it did not include loss of any nature, even if it had some connection with the business if the same cannot be said to be incidental to the business. – Haji Aziz, wherein the Supreme Court held that penalty for an infraction of the law can never be said to arise out of the business. The role in which an assessee conducts an activity for which a penalty is laid is different from the role that an assessee assumes while conducting his business. Therefore such a loss caused due to the penalty can never be regarded as a commercial loss. – Soni Hinduji Kushalji & Co.’s case where the Andhra Pradesh High Court considered the law laid down on deduction of loss incurred by way of confiscation and penalty. It was held that a loss must be one arising directly from the business or trade, being incidental to it, as laid down by this Court in Badridas Daga’s case. The Court, while noting the decision of this Court in Maqbool Hussain v. State of Bombay, and Haji Aziz & Abdul Shakoor Bros, held that confiscation of contraband being an action in rem is not available for deduction, as the same, by no process of reasoning can be said to be trading or commercial loss connected with or incidental to the assessee’s business. – J. S. Parkar, where the Bombay High Court followed the ratio laid down in Haji Aziz and Soni Hinduji Kushalji While dealing with the decision of the Supreme Court in Piara Singh, Sundresh J. held that the Supreme Court in that case drew a distinction between an infraction of law committed in carrying out a lawful business as against one committed in an inherently unlawful business. However, according to Sundresh J., the decisions of Haji Aziz andBadridas Daga were not considered in Piara Singh. Therefore Sundresh J. held: “We would only clarify the position that, in any case, the law as laid down in Piara Singh case may not have any application to a case of deduction of expenditure/loss incurred on account of penalty/confiscation coming under section 37(1) of the Act, particularly in light of Explanation 1.” While dealing with Dr. T A Quereshi v. CIT  relied upon by the assessee, Sundresh J. held that TA Qureshi merely followed Piara Singh without taking note of the binding principles laid down in Haji Aziz, Badridas Daga. Sundresh J. therefore observed: “Therefore, there cannot be a situation where an assessee carrying on an illegal business can claim deduction of expenses or losses incurred in the course of that business, while another assessee carrying on a legitimate one cannot seek deduction for loss incurred on account of either a confiscation or penalty. The interpretation of section 37 of the Act given by the Court in Dr. T.A. Quereshi case, leads to a situation where the expenditure incurred in manufacturing something illegal may not be allowable as a deduction in view of the Explanation 1, however, if upon seizure, the manufactured goods are confiscated, in that case deduction will be allowable on commercial principles. This classification being artificial not borne out by statute, which mischief is sought to be clarified by the Explanation, has no legal basis.” The second part of this post will consider the reasoning and analysis in further detail. – Rucha A Vaidya Taxation"

            "Snake Oil or Standards: A Critical Analysis of SEBI’s Index Provider Regulation By GuestAugust 13, 20237 Min readAdd comment   [Ritvij Ratn Tiwari is a 4th-year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) student at the National Law School of India University, Bangalore] The Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (“SEBI”) recent decision to withhold its proposal for regulating index providers has placed the spotlight on a significant juncture in the regulatory landscape surrounding the financial markets in India. In December last year, SEBI unveiled a Consultation Paper (“CP”) outlining a prospective framework to oversee index providers operating within India. The main trigger for this regulatory move was the massive growth of passive funds linked to market indices, with assets under management in such index-linked investments crossing Rs 6 lakh crore in 2022.  Amidst this exponential surge, SEBI had growing worries about potential conflicts of interest, excessive discretion, and a lack of transparency in how index providers construct these underlying indices. The core apprehension revolved around the prospect that index providers could wield discretionary power by manipulating methodologies, leading to the inclusion or exclusion of stocks or adjustments to constituent weights. Such alterations have the potential to reverberate across stock volumes, liquidity, pricing dynamics, and investor returns emanating from index-linked funds. Since there was a regulatory vacuum, SEBI proposed to regulate these providers by importing the standards prescribed by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) to the Indian landscape. This post aims to assess and critique SEBI’s regulatory proposal. It argues against the creation of a new regulation and instead advocates for integrating index providers into the existing framework of investment advisors, akin to the approach planned by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Backdrop of Passive Investment Funds  Traditionally, a securities index has been a concise snapshot capturing the market’s temperament at a particular instant. Its fundamental role has been informational – furnishing market players with crucial insights for their endeavours. Over the last couple of decades, an evolved role has emerged. Indices now underpin “passive” investing, epitomized by index funds. The defining feature of these funds is that their portfolios are designed to mimic the constituents of the relevant index. Since the index is constructed from a list of constituents and weights, the fund will simply form a portfolio that consists roughly of these same securities in proportions that are approximately the same as those weights. While index providers disclose the methodology of index construction publicly, they still exercise discretion and administration through subjective interpretations of selection criteria, thereby rebalancing the rules and timing. Despite claims of rules-based functioning, index providers make discretionary decisions in applying those rules that sway returns of passive funds tracking them. Consequently, SEBI embarked on formulating a regulatory structure. The Regulatory Proposal The proposed regulation applies to index providers based on the usage of their indices in India – for benchmarking, passive products or derivatives trading. This extraterritorial application is rooted in SEBI’s investor protection principlethat regulations must cover products marketed to Indian investors regardless of the source. However, indices used only abroad escape this oversight based on the territoriality principle, limiting SEBI’s powers to India’s geographical jurisdiction. The proposed regulatory framework aims to bring governance and transparency to index providers through adherence to IOSCO principles. Eligibility criteria such as minimum net worth requirement, restrictions to prevent conflicts of interest, mandates to ensure index quality, due diligence of data sources, public disclosures and periodic audits are part of the framework. It also posits uniformity in the calculation of an index by using standard factors such as availability and sufficiency. Index Providers as Investment Advisors The regulatory discourse, as also highlighted in the CP draws attention to the SEC’s recent inquiry in June 2022. The SEC sought public opinions on whether specific index providers should be considered ‘investment advisers’ in accordance with the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“US Act”). Interestingly, the CP omits any reference to the relevant Indian regulations – the SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 (“SEBI Regulations”). There are strong similarities between the definition of “investment adviser” under the US Act and the SEBI Regulations. The US Act defines an investment adviser as someone engaged for compensation in advising others on investing in securities or issuing reports or analysis on securities. Similarly, the SEBI Regulations define an investment adviser as someone engaged for consideration in providing investment advice on securities or investment products. Both have three essential requirements – providing advice on securities, doing so as a business activity, and receiving compensation for it. The concept of “advising others” in the US Act matches with “providing investment advice” in the Indian regulations. Now, index providers fit squarely within this regulatory ambit based on their role in passive funds. They design market indices that passive mutual funds and exchange-traded funds track to deliver index-linked returns to investors. In doing so, index providers analyse the securities market and provide advice to passive funds on which securities to invest in and their allocation by way of the index composition and weightings. This constitutes securities investment advice. Passive funds invest solely based on the index to deliver indexed returns to investors. Hence, the index is the key advisory input that determines the funds’ investments and portfolios. Index providers also receive licensing fees from passive funds for the use of the indices, meeting the compensation criteria. Further, licensing indices is a regular business activity for index providers. They are engaged full-time in constructing indices specifically for use by passive funds. Therefore, through their advisory role in enabling passive funds’ security selection and portfolio construction, index providers fulfill all regulatory criteria – securities investment advice, commercial service, and compensation. Therefore, it makes sense that if index providers, due to their involvement with passive funds, meet the criteria of an investment advisor, the appropriate regulation to be applied is the SEBI Regulations. A Redundant Regulatory Framework The SEBI Regulations already encapsulate entities that provide investment advice, research, and recommendations on financial products. Index providers supplying indices serving as benchmarks for financial products logically fall under the definition of investment advisers. By using the already existing standard, regulatory harmony would prevail, fostering consistency and coherence across the financial sector. The foundational principles of transparency, conflict of interest management, and client protection embedded within the investment advisor framework are inherently pertinent to the activities of index providers. This integration not only sidesteps redundancy but also streamlines regulatory efforts, optimizing resources for the robust execution of oversight. The investor advisor regulations mandate registration, certification, disclosures, conduct norms, and record maintenance. These existing norms already address the market risks posed by index providers to a significant extent. Introducing another layer of regulation without evidence of gaps would increase compliance burdens without commensurate benefits. Imposing a separate set of rules on index providers would lead to regulatory fragmentation by subjecting one part of the investment advisory industry to disparate norms. This goes against the principle of regulatory consistency. A knee-jerk reaction to devising sui generis regulation for index providers in India may further stifle financial innovation and growth in the indexing industry. Conclusion The exponential growth of passive funds linked to market indices, coupled with concerns about conflicts of interest and transparency, has triggered this regulatory move. However, the proposition of introducing a new regulatory framework raises questions about its necessity and effectiveness. By avoiding redundancy and adopting an integrated approach, regulatory consistency and coherence across the financial sector can be achieved. As international players like MSCI and FTSE might consider discontinuing their index services due to regulatory uncertainties, it becomes even more crucial for SEBI to adopt an approach that balances investor protection with the facilitation of a conducive environment for financial innovation. Furthermore, we need to consider the unique complexities of creating indices. The decisions made by index providers can affect not only specific investments but also the entire market’s balance. To strengthen the SEBI Regulations, we could think about improving them based on the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks, especially focusing on the methodology of index construction and quality. – Ritvij Ratn Tiwari Capital Markets SEBI"

            "NCLT Order in Zee-Sony Merger Reiterates High Onus on Objectors By Umakanth VarottilAugust 13, 20236 Min readAdd comment   The proposed merger of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited with Sony’s India operations (through its entity Culver Max Entertainment Private Limited) has attracted considerable attention. This is essentially due to some governance and financial circumstances surrounding the Zee group. Zee Entertainment was the subject matter of shareholder activism spearheaded by an institutional investor, Invesco, although the investor subsequently divested its stake in the company. Several lenders of the Zee group had initiated proceeding to recover debts due to them, which continue to be pending before different legal and regulatory for. More recently, the promoters of Zee Entertainment, being Mr. Subhash Chandra and Mr. Punit Goenka, were subject to an interim order by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) that barred them from holding a position in any listed company, in which the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) refused to interfere. Scheme and Objections These circumstances are a clear indication that the proposed merger transaction between Zee Entertainment and Sony India was unlikely to be smooth sailing, which indeed turned out to be the case. Although the scheme of arrangement for amalgamation of the two companies was approved by 99.997% of Zee Entertainment’s shareholders and it received the backing of the requisite majority of creditors, it garnered a litany of objections when the merger proposal arrived at the doorstep of the National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai Bench (NCLT) for its sanctification. By way of its order passed in Axis Finance Limited v. Zee Entertainment Limited (10 August 2023), the NCLT overruled the objections and approved the scheme, thereby paving the way for implementation of the Zee-Sony merger. The objections to the scheme emerged from various creditors of the Zee group, including Axis Finance Limited, IDBI Trusteeship Services Limited, IMAX Corporation, IDBI Bank Limited, and JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Private Limited (in respect of funds lent by Yes Bank Limited). Their protestations to the merger were two-fold. First, they argued that a non-compete fee of over INR 1,100 crores was being paid by a Sony group entity in Mauritius to a Zee group entity, Essel Mauritius. The objectors’ argument is that such a non-compete payment “is bogus and a disguised mechanism to cheat lenders & public shareholders of Zee” (at paragraph 3(i)). The creditors effectively sought to have some form of recourse to the non-compete amounts as a means towards realization of the amounts owed to them. Second, the objectors argued that the terms of the scheme by which Mr. Goenka was to be appointed the CEO of the merged entity militates against SEBI’s order which prevents him from acting on the board of any listed company. The NCLT failed to be persuaded by either of the objections. Creditor Interests and Locus Standi The NCLT found that the objecting creditors were owed amounts from various group entities of Zee Entertainment and not by the very company that was part of the merger and hence proceedings that were before the NCLT. In other words, there was no privity of contract between the objectors and Zee Entertainment, and that the objectors were effectively capitalizing on the opportunity that arose through the merger to assuage their personal recoveries which were unconnected with the proposal before the NCLT. Moreover, even where any amounts were to be owed by Zee Entertainment, they were disputed by the parties and are yet to be crystallized. In these circumstances, such creditors would not have the ability to participate in the decision-making process for a scheme of arrangement. In any event, the NCLT found that given the net worth of the combined company would be manifold compared to a similar measure for Zee Enterprises as a standalone entity, creditors ought not to be prejudiced. While a large portion of the NCLT’s reasoning is premised on the specific facts and circumstances relating to each of the objectors’ connection (or lack thereof) with Zee Entertainment and the present scheme, the order also reiterates some points that pertain to the state of the law. At the outset, unlike the preceding regime under sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956, the present corporate law regime contained in sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 places hurdles on the ability of shareholders, creditors or other interested parties from objecting to the scheme during the proceedings before the NCLT. Specifically, section 230(4) of the 2013 legislation stipulates that objections can be made only by persons who hold not less than 10% of the shareholding or have outstanding debt of at least 5%. The NCLT found that none of the objectors satisfied these threshold requirements to gain locus standi in the scheme proceedings. More importantly, the NCLT relied on the well-established principles enunciated in the landmark case of Miheer Mafatlal v. Mafatlal Industries Limited by which the NCLT is allowed to intervene in the commercial wisdom of shareholders and creditors who have approved a scheme only if such a “scheme is unconscionable, illegal, unfair, or unjust to the class of shareholders or creditors for whom it is meant” (paragraph 7 of Zee Entertainment). In that sense, there is a high bar for objectors to a scheme of arrangement. The NCLT did not expand on specific aspects of the scheme and the extent to which it can exercise oversight, presumably because the objectors were unable to satisfy it as to the maintainability of their objections. However, even if one were to assume that the objectors had to the locus standi to seek to assuage their concerns before the NCLT, the tenor of its order suggests that it is unlikely to have intervened on specific terms of the scheme, such as the non-compete clause, once the scheme has received the support of the requisite majority of shareholders and creditors. In that sense, the NCLT’s approach is indicative a high bar that objectors must cross before they can invoke the NCLT’s intervention in a scheme of arrangement. Managerial Position As for the objection relating to the appointment of Mr. Goenka as CEO of the merged entity in the face of the SEBI order banning his role as a director on any listed company, the NCLT seem to have tread a middle path. While it approved the scheme as a whole, the NCLT left it to the board of the company to examine the appointment of the CEO subsequently, and also clarified that the observations of the NCLT bench is subject to orders under other regulations, such as the approval of SEBI. Although the NCLT seems to have extricated itself from the controversy, and refused to turn down the clause in the scheme relating to Mr. Goenka’s as CEO, his appointment would nevertheless be subject to the fate of the proceedings emanating from SEBI’s order. Conclusion At one level, the NCLT’s order is somewhat straightforward, as it has ruled based significantly on the facts and circumstances of the case. However, at a broader level, it has adopted a non-interventionist approach given scope of the NCLT’s jurisdiction as articulated by the Supreme Court. However, due to the financial situation of the Zee group and the various disputes it is currently battling with lenders, the Zee-Sony merger will likely be the subject matter of appeals by one or more objectors.

            "NCLAT’s Verdict Reshapes the Interplay Between Arbitration and Insolvency By GuestAugust 10, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Mohammad Kaif is a final year student at Campus Law Centre, Faculty of Law, University of Delhi] The judgment of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) Chennai Bench in KK Ropeways Limited v. Billion Smiles Hospitality has significant implications for the interplay between arbitration and insolvency proceedings in India. The central question addressed by the NCLAT was whether a petition filed under section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) for the implementation of an arbitral award is maintainable. In its ruling, the NCLAT held that such a petition is not maintainable and clarified that arbitration and IBC proceedings cannot run simultaneously. The NCLAT’s ruling clarifies the concept of ‘existence of dispute’ and its impact on the initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). This post examines the key legal issues and explores the implications of the NCLAT’s verdict in promoting efficiency, discouraging forum shopping, and reinforcing the sanctity of arbitral awards. Additionally, the post will also discuss the Supreme Court’s interpretation of ‘existence of dispute’ in a related case to provide further clarity on the matter. Background Facts: The Lease Agreement Dispute and the Arbitral Award The dispute in question originated from a lease agreement between KK Ropeways Limited (the operational creditor) and Billion Smiles Hospitality Private Limited (the corporate debtor). The parties decided to resolve their dispute through arbitration and, on 29 November 2018, the arbitral tribunal issued an ex-parte award in favour of the operational creditor, amounting to Rs. 26,33,022/- along with interest at the rate of 15% per annum. However, the corporate debtor was dissatisfied with the award and chose to challenge it under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act). As a result, the award was pending adjudication before a court of law. In the meanwhile, the operational creditor filed a petition under Section 9 of the IBC seeking the initiation of the CIRP against the corporate debtor, relying on the arbitral award as the basis for the default amount. However, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) rejected the petition, asserting that the appeal against the ex-parte award indicated the existence of a pre-existing dispute between the parties. The NCLT opined that filing such a petition for the implementation of an arbitral award was inconsistent with the objectives of the IBC. Aggrieved by the NCLT’s order, the operational creditor appealed to the NCLAT. Legal Issue at Hand: Maintainability of Section 9 Petitions under the IBC  The central legal issue is whether a petition filed under section 9 of the IBC 2016, seeking the implementation of an arbitral award, is maintainable when there is a pending challenge against the arbitral award under section 34 of the A&C Act). NCLAT’s Verdict: Clarifying the Concept of ‘Existence of Dispute’ The NCLAT examined the concept of ‘existence of dispute’ as a ground for rejecting a section 9 petition under the IBC. It clarified that the term encompasses the act of raising a dispute before a court of law or an arbitral tribunal even before the receipt of a demand notice under section 8 of the IBC. Furthermore, the existence of an appeal against an arbitral award does not nullify the dispute; the dispute remains alive during the pendency of the appeal. However, to dismiss a petition filed under the IBC, the NCLAT emphasized that the dispute raised by the petitioner must not be spurious, imaginary, or hypothetical. Crucially, the NCLAT held that arbitration proceedings and IBC proceedings cannot be conducted simultaneously. It pointed out that since the arbitral award arose from the rental dispute, and the corporate debtor had already filed an appeal against the award, the operational debt could only be considered under dispute. The NCLAT emphasized that for the initiation of the CIRP against a corporate debtor, there should be no real dispute existing between the parties involved in the debt. As long as the arbitration award is challenged under the relevant section of the A&C Act, the operational debt remains under dispute. Therefore, in accordance with settled law and the principles laid down in the judgment of the Supreme Court in K. Kishan v. Vijay Nirman Co., the petition under section 9 of the IBC is not maintainable in the present case as the arbitral award in question is disputed by way of a section 34 appeal, and the said appeal is pending. Supreme Court’s Interpretation of ‘Existence of Dispute’ under the IBC The Supreme Court of India has provided essential clarity to the provisions of the IBC concerning the existence of a dispute, addressing the need for unambiguous interpretation on this matter. The case in question, Mobilox Innovations (P) Ltd. v. Kirusa Software (P). Ltd., revolves around a contractual dispute between the appellant (Mobilox) and the respondent (Kirusa) arising from tele-voting services provided for the ‘Nach Baliye’ programme on Star TV. Kirusa issued monthly invoices, which Mobilox withheld, claiming a breach of the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Kirusa subsequently sent a demand notice under section 8 of the IBC, prompting Mobilox to assert the existence of serious and bona fide disputes between the parties, suggesting that the demand notice was a pressure tactic. The matter was brought before the NCLT which initially dismissed the application. However, the NCLAT later remitted the case to the NCLT, stating that the corporate debtor had failed to fulfil the condition stipulated in section 8(2) of the IBC, making the defence of claiming a dispute vague and motivated to evade liability. The Supreme Court provided significant directions to the adjudicating authority (AA) when examining the admissibility of an application under section 9 of the IBC. The AA is required to determine whether there is an ‘operational debt’ exceeding Rs. 1 lakh and whether the documentary evidence furnished with the application shows that the debt is due and payable and has not been paid. Moreover, the AA must ascertain the existence of a dispute between the parties or the record of a pending suit or arbitration proceeding related to the unpaid operational debt. Failure to meet any of these conditions would result in the rejection of the application. The Court resolved the conflict between the words ‘and’ and ‘or’ in section 8(2)(a) of the IBC, which deals with the obligation of the corporate debtor to bring to the notice of the operational creditor the existence of a dispute or record of pendency of a suit or arbitration proceedings. The Court interpreted the legislative intent and held that the term ‘and’ should be read as ‘or’ to avoid anomalous situations where disputes could arise shortly before triggering the insolvency process, leaving no time to approach an arbitral tribunal or a court. The Court also discussed the meaning of ‘genuine dispute’, drawing insights from international judgments. It stated that the AA should look for a plausible contention requiring investigation and that the dispute should not be patently feeble or spurious. The Court emphasized that it is not necessary to examine the merits of the dispute at this stage, and a genuine dispute exists if there is a real dispute as to payment between the parties. Overall, the judgment in Mobilox Innovations is crucial as it provides a broad construction of the term ‘dispute’ under the IBC, resolving doubts and clarifying the scope of the dispute. It stands in contrast to previous judgments that adopted a more rigid view, ensuring that disputes are not used as mere bluster to evade insolvency proceedings. Implications of NCLAT’s Verdict The NCLAT’s ruling has several implications on the interaction between arbitration and insolvency laws in India: Clarity on Timing and Sequencing of Actions The verdict clarifies that parties must be mindful of the timing and sequencing of actions concerning arbitration and insolvency matters. Initiating a CIRP under the IBC based on an arbitral award that is under challenge may lead to the dismissal of the petition due to the existence of a pre-existing dispute. Prevention of Forum Shopping The ruling discourages parties from engaging in forum shopping, where they attempt to pursue simultaneous remedies in both arbitration and insolvency forums to achieve favourable outcomes. It promotes the resolution of disputes through appropriate channels without causing procedural delays or inconsistent decisions. Efficiency and Streamlining of Proceedings By emphasizing that arbitration and insolvency proceedings cannot run concurrently, the NCLAT ensures a more efficient and streamlined resolution of disputes related to debt and insolvency. This approach avoids duplication of efforts and minimizes the burden on both parties and the judicial system. Encouragement of Compliance and Good Faith The verdict encourages parties to act in good faith during arbitration proceedings and comply with arbitral awards without resorting to tactics aimed at delaying or evading enforcement. It reinforces the sanctity of arbitral awards and their enforceability. Conclusion The NCLAT’s verdict in KK Ropeways Limited clarifies the maintainability of a petition under section 9 of the IBC for the implementation of an arbitral award. The ruling underscores that arbitration and insolvency proceedings cannot be conducted simultaneously and that a genuine dispute existing between the parties involved in the debt prevents the initiation of the CIRP. This landmark judgment ensures a more efficient and effective resolution of disputes related to debt and insolvency in India, promoting the sanctity of arbitral awards and encouraging parties to act in good faith during the arbitration process. Parties engaged in arbitration and insolvency matters must be mindful of this ruling’s implications to avoid procedural hurdles and achieve timely resolution of their disputes. – Mohammad Kaif Arbitration Insolvency"

            "Reinforcing Secured Creditors’ Rights: Insights from the Ronak Industries Case By GuestAugust 10, 20238 Min read1 comment   [Shruti Srivastava is a 4th year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) student at National Law University and Judicial Academy, Assam]  In the ever-evolving landscape of financial regulations, the concept of a secured creditor has assumed significant importance. A momentous shift occurred with the introduction of section 26-E in The Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act, 2002), endowing secured creditors with priority over their counterparts in the resolution of outstanding dues. Echoing the significance of this shift, the Bombay High Court, in the landmark case of Ronak Industries v. Assistant Commissioner Central Excise & Customs (28 June 2023), reaffirmed the priority of securing creditors in debt repayment. This post examines the implications of the Ronak Industries case, shedding light on the priority given to secured creditors under section 26-E of the SARFAESI Act, 2002. Facts of the Case  On 14 December 2007, Mr. Prem Prakash Sarogi, acting as the guarantor for Goldstar Polymer Pvt. Ltd. (the borrower), mortgaged the secured asset to Bank of Baroda to secure facilities provided to the borrower. It is pertinent to note that this mortgage predated any attachment levied on the secured asset by the Assistant Commissioner Central Excise & Customs and the Assistant Commissioner CGST & Central Excise. Following the prescribed legal procedures, Bank of Baroda duly registered its security interest over the secured asset with the Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest (CERSAI) on the 24 February 2012. Subsequently, due to non-payment of dues owed to Bank of Baroda, they exercised their rights under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, and proceeded to sell the secured asset to Ronak Industries, the petitioner in the present case. Following the sale, Bank of Baroda also issued a sale certificate in favor of Ronak Industries, further validating the transfer of ownership. However, the problem arose when the Sub-Registrar refused to register the sale certificate issued to Ronak Industries. The refusal was based on the presence of a lien, charge, encumbrance, or mutation entry attributed to the Assistant Commissioner Central Excise & Customs and the Assistant Commissioner CGST & Central Excise in the records maintained by both the Sub Registrar and the Mamlatdar concerning the secured asset. Considering these circumstances, Ronak Industries asked for the removal of any lien, charges, encumbrance, or mutation entry, if registered by the Assistant Commissioner Central Excise & Customs and the Assistant Commissioner CGST & Central Excise with the Mamlatdar. Additionally, Ronak Industries requested a directive from the Sub-Registrar to officially record and register the sale certificate/sale deed (issued by Bank of Baroda to Ronak Industries) under the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908, ensuring that it is free from any encumbrances attributed to the Assistant Commissioner Central Excise & Customs and the Assistant Commissioner CGST & Central Excise. What do the Law and Precedents Say? The priority of secured creditors has been spoken about in several legislations, but this case primarily deals with section 26-E of the SARFESI Act, 2002, and section 31B of the Recovery of Debt and Bankruptcy Act, 1993. Section 26-E states that once the security interest is registered, the debts due to the secured creditors will take priority over all other dues. Additionally, section 31B emphasizes the priority granted to secured creditors over any other forms of debt. This is not the first instance where a court had been grappled with such a scenario; there have been numerous cases where the court had to discern whether the government or the secured creditor should be prioritized for repayment of unpaid dues. In Dena Bank v. Bhikhabhai Prabhudas Parekh & Co., the Supreme Court categorically ruled that crowned debts do not enjoy any preferential treatment over secured debts. The crown’s preferential right to recover debts is confined solely to ordinary or unsecured debts. In Bank of Bihar v. State of Bihar, the Supreme Court established a vital principle regarding the rights of a pawnee. This principle affirms that the pawnee, who provides money to the pawnor against the security of goods, retains a valid claim over the goods. Even if the goods are lawfully seized to make funds available to other creditors of the pawnor, the rights of the pawnee cannot be extinguished until their claim is first fully satisfied. Moreover, in ICICI Bank Ltd. v. SIDCO Leathers Ltd., the Supreme Court unambiguously affirmed that secured creditors are granted preference and priority over government departments’ outstanding dues, provided that the proceedings of I&B and CERSAI registration are duly adhered to. These legal precedents solidify the position of secured creditors and highlight the importance of proper registration to provide the secured creditors their rightful priority in the event of debt recovery. Bombay High Court’s Judgment The Bombay High Court in Ronak Industries based its judgment on a comprehensive analysis of several relevant cases, including the precedent set by it in Jalgaon Janta Sahakari Bank Ltd. v. Joint Commissioner of Sales Tax Nodal 9, Mumbai. The full bench in that case held that if a secured creditor’s security interest has been duly registered with the CERSAI, the creditor is entitled to priority over the government in the settlement of dues. Furthermore, the Court ruled that following the enforcement of Chapter IV-A of the SARFAESI Act, 2002 any government department seeking to recover its dues must register such claims with CERSAI under sub-section (4) of section 26B. Additionally, sub-section (2) of section 26C states that any attachment order issued after the registration of the security interest with CERSAI shall be subject to the prior registered claim. Therefore government authorities must register their claims with CERSAI to assert their right to recover dues. In the present case, the Assistant Commissioner Central Excise & Customs and the Assistant Commissioner CGST & Central Excise failed to register their claim with CERSAI, resulting in their inability to claim their dues. In Jalgaon Janta Sahakari Bank Ltd. the Bombay High Court also critically examined the term priority as defined under section 26-E of the SARFAESI Act, 2002. According to the Black’s Law Dictionary, priority denotes taking precedence over others. In the context of the legislation at hand, it signifies the right to enforce a claim ahead of other competing interests. To ensure clarity in the distribution of proceeds from the sale of a borrower’s properties, the Parliament wisely opted for the phrase priority over all other dues in the SARFAESI Act, 2002. This choice was made considering the prevalent use of the first charge in various legislations. Notably, the inclusion of non-obstante clauses in sections 31B and 26-E of the Act supports the reasonable notion that the secured creditor’s dues shall take precedence over all other obligations, including revenues, taxes, cesses, and rates payable to the Central Government, State Government, or local authority. This provision establishes a well-defined framework for the inter-se distribution of proceeds, ensuring that the secured creditor’s claims are prioritized above all other competing interests. The Bombay High Court in Ronak Industries resolved the dispute regarding the settlement priority of dues between the secured creditor and the Central Government, State Government, or local authority under section 26-E of the SARFAESI Act, 2002 by stating that the secured creditor holds priority over all others in the settlement of dues. The Court also held that any lien, charges, encumbrance, or mutation entry registered by the Assistant Commissioner Central Excise & Customs or the Assistant Commissioner CGST & Central Excise with the Mamlatdar cannot be allowed. Moreover, the Court ruled that the Sub Registrar must register the sale certificate/sale deed following the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908, without any lien, charges, encumbrance, or mutation entry. Conclusion Rashbehary Ghose, in the book Law of Mortgage, said that in India, government debt does not hold precedence over secured debt. The practice of granting higher priority to secured creditors incentivizes lending by reducing the perceived risk associated with providing loans. This increases confidence among creditors fostering a greater willingness to extend credit to borrowers. Furthermore, a significant number of secured creditors comprise institutional investors and individuals who have invested their savings in financial instruments such as bonds or securitized assets. Providing them priority protection ensures the safeguarding of their interests and promotes overall confidence in the stability of financial markets. Through a series of legal precedents and established principles, the stance on granting priority to secured creditors over others in settling dues has been unequivocally defined. This jurisprudential clarity aims to strike a delicate balance between encouraging lending and investment while upholding the interests of diverse secured creditors within the broader financial market. The principle of prioritizing secured creditors stands as an integral aspect of India’s legal framework, striving to foster a robust and well-functioning financial market that benefits both creditors and borrowers. – Shruti Srivastava Debt Finance"

            "IBC Overrides Electricity Act: Capturing the Fallacy in Rainbow Papers By GuestAugust 8, 20237 Min readAdd comment   [Praveen Sharma is a 5th Year Student at MNLU Mumbai] Recently in Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. v. Raman Ispat Private Limited, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) overrides the Electricity Act, 2003. While dismissing the appeal of Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), the Court provided crucial clarification regarding the rights of creditors operating under the IBC. This clarification encompasses both secured and unsecured creditors, ensuring that they hold priority in having their debts repaid before any dues owed to the State or Central Governments are settled. In essence, this ruling reinforces the principle of prioritizing private creditors’ claims over government obligations when it comes to resolving insolvency matters. In this post, the author argues that this judgment prudently captures the fallacy in the State Tax Officer v. Rainbow Papers Ltd. and not only upholds the rights of creditors, but also establishes a clear hierarchy in debt repayment. Background of the Case Raman Ispat Pvt. Ltd (the corporate debtor) had entered into an agreement with PVVNL for supply of electricity. A clause of the agreement provided that the outstanding dues will be a charge on the assets of the corporate debtor. This recovery mechanism was derived from the Electricity Act 2003, and the regulations framed under it, including the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Supply Code 2005. Dues remained unpaid by the corporate debtor from time to time; subsequently, PVVNL attached the properties of the corporate debtor by an order of the District Collector. After an unsuccessful resolution process, the corporate debtor went into liquidation. The liquidator contended that PVVNL’s claim would fall under section 53 of the IBC and would be classified in order of priority under that provision. It was contended by the liquidator that PVVNL would be entitled to pro rata distribution of proceeds along with the other secured creditors from sale of liquidation assets. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) sided with the liquidator and directed the District Collector to release the property. The NCLAT upheld the NCLT’s reasoning that PVVNL fell within the definition of ‘operational creditor’ and should realize its dues in the liquidation process. Observations of the Supreme Court In the appeal before the Supreme Court, PVVNL contended that Electricity Act is a ‘special enactment’ and therefore should prevail over IBC which is a ‘general law’. However, the Supreme Court held that the NCLT and the NCLAT rightfully set aside the attachment of the property of the corporate debtor and held that PVVNL can realize its dues by participating in the liquidation process as per the IBC. The Supreme Court held that section 238 of the IBC overrides the Electricity Act. The Supreme Court emphasized that the dues owed to creditors under the IBC hold a superior position compared to the electricity dues payable under the Electricity Act. Analysis of the Judgement The Raman Ispat judgment provides a comprehensive analysis of the IBC, with special attention to the ‘waterfall mechanism’ stipulated in section 53 thereof . Notably, the Supreme Court underscores that government debts are accorded a lower priority compared to the debts owed to unsecured financial creditors within the IBC framework. The Supreme Court’s recognition of the supremacy of debts owed to unsecured financial creditors over government debts signifies a significant shift in the precedence of repayment obligations. This ruling strengthens the position of unsecured creditors and underscores the importance of honouring private financial commitments within the insolvency regime. The Supreme Court placed significant emphasis on the ‘waterfall mechanism’ delineated in section 53 of the IBC. This provision gives priority to the payment of debts to secured creditors who waive their right to enforce security when the liquidation process commences. The Court highlighted that these secured creditors, alongside the payment of workmen’s dues, hold the second position in the order of repayment, immediately after the settlement of insolvency resolution process costs and liquidation costs. Moreover, the Court pointed out that even secured creditors who choose not to waive their rights to enforce security, along with unsecured creditors, are ranked higher in the repayment scheme compared to government agencies that are owed money by the corporate debtor under section 53 of the IBC. In the Raman Ispat judgement, the Supreme Court noted that in multiple reports leading to the design of the IBC, and in the Preamble of the IBC itself, there were consistent references to the reduction of priority for debts owed to the government. These debts encompass statutory taxes, other dues payable to the Central or State Government, as well as amounts payable into the Consolidated Fund on behalf of either government. The Supreme Court emphasized that these government-related dues should be treated distinctly and separately from the debts owed to secured creditors. Rectifying Rainbow Papers Judgement While contending that Electricity Act is a special enactment and thus would prevail over IBC which is a general law, PVVNL placed reliance on the judgement of the Supreme Court in Rainbow Papers. PVVNL contended that the Supreme Court in that case determined that when a security interest is established in favour of the government for tax claims under the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003, the government assumes the role of a secured creditor within the context of the IBC. In Rainbow Papers, the Supreme Court clarified that any resolution plan that omits the payment of such taxes or statutory dues owed to the government would not align with the provisions of the IBC and, consequently, would not be legally binding on the State. While referring to Rainbow Papers, the Supreme Court in Raman Ispat observed that the meticulous arrangement of section 53 places the amounts payable to secured creditors and workmen in the second position, just after the liquidator’s costs and expenses during the liquidation process. The Supreme Court further observed that the dues owed to the government are placed significantly lower in priority compared to secured creditors, unsecured creditors, and operational creditors. It is in this regard that the Court observed that this ‘particular design’ either went unnoticed or was not brought to the Court’s attention in Rainbow Papers. Therefore, it observed that the judgment failed to acknowledge the provisions of the IBC, which grant higher priority to dues payable to secured creditors over those owed to the Central or State Government. The Supreme Court pointed out that Rainbow Papers overlooked the essential ‘waterfall mechanism’ in section 53 of the IBC, which determines the priority of debt repayment during insolvency. This raises concerns about the judgment’s thoroughness and adherence to the legislative framework. The ‘waterfall mechanism’ establishes a structured order of debt settlement, giving priority to insolvency resolution process costs, followed by dues to secured creditors who waive their security interest, and workmen’s dues. The Court’s observation may impact the outcome of the Rainbow Papers case, necessitating a reevaluation considering the relevant provisions of the IBC. Conclusion In conclusion, the Raman Ispat judgment delivered by the Supreme Court stands as a remarkable testament to well-reasoned and conceptually clear legal interpretation. By delving into the intricate details of the case, the Court adeptly highlighted the overriding authority of the IBC over the Electricity Act, settling any ambiguity regarding their respective applicability. One of the pivotal aspects of the judgment was the meticulous analysis of the ‘waterfall mechanism’ under section 53 of the IBC. By recognizing that government debts hold a lower priority compared to those owed to unsecured financial creditors, the Court reaffirmed the significance of adhering to a structured order of debt repayment during insolvency proceedings. This observation provides a robust foundation for maintaining fairness and transparency in insolvency resolution, ensuring the equitable treatment of all stakeholders involved. Moreover, the Court astutely brought attention to the incongruity in the Rainbow Paper judgment. By scrutinizing the provisions of the IBC and the hierarchy of debt repayment, the Court skillfully exposed the oversight in the earlier ruling, which failed to acknowledge the distinct and lower priority given to government dues. This critical observation reinforces the need for comprehensive consideration of relevant provisions in all legal judgments to avoid potential discrepancies and uphold the principles of justice. As we look ahead, this landmark ruling will serve as a guiding light for future cases, promoting a more cohesive and equitable insolvency regime in the country. – Praveen Sharma Insolvency Interpretation of statutes"

        "title": "Mandatory Arbitration Clauses: A Threat to Labour in India?",
        "read_on_content": [
            "Mandatory Arbitration Clauses: A Threat to Labour in India? By GuestAugust 7, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Nankee Arora is a fourth-year law student at Jindal Global Law School] Mandatory arbitration clauses have become increasingly prevalent in employment contracts around the world. Employers seek to bind their employees to arbitration from the inception of their employment contract so in the event a claim arises they can take recourse to the speedier but more importantly confidential and largely two-party dispute resolution mechanism that is arbitration. The cumulative effect of such clauses is the suppression of collective bargaining and labour rights. In India in particular, while arbitration has gained widespread popularity, the question of arbitrability of labour disputes is still undecided. This post seeks to examine how mandatory arbitration clauses threaten to erode the very spirit of arbitration, that is, its voluntary and consensual nature and uses the United States as an example of a jurisdiction where legitimacy was given to such clauses. It will also take up the limited jurisprudence on arbitrability of employment disputes in India to suggest that such clauses are unlikely to be implemented for the public policy reasons. Mandatory Arbitration Clauses: A Threat  Mandatory arbitration clauses require employers to agree that any future disputes that arise between them and the company will be resolved through arbitration and cannot be taken to court. While it may be argued that the employee is consenting to this dispute resolution mechanism by signing the agreement, the employee has no real choice to negotiate this term given that their employment is contingent on agreeing to the terms of the company. Employers take advantage of the fact that they are in a stronger bargaining position in the employer-employee relationship to enforce such stipulations and curb the employees’ power. This problem is exacerbated in socio-economically weaker nations given that the degree of inequality between the employer and employee is greater and the competitiveness of the job market is higher thereby allowing the employer to stipulate a myriad of conditions that the employee is compelled to follow, rendering consent into a mere façade. Additionally, although arbitration was brought forward as a speedier dispute resolution mechanism, with mandatory arbitration clauses it is questionable whether the dispute will ever be fully resolved. Firstly, within its ambit, mandatory arbitration clauses internationally include all kinds of disputes, including disputes related to different types of leave, renumeration and even claims of racial or sexual discrimination. Allowing such disputes to remain within the private realm is a blatant public policy violation seeing that wrong-doers would be let off the hook without any public repercussions. Moreover, their history of committing such acts would not be available to their future employees thereby enabling them to become repeat offenders across multiple workplaces. There is also a question of financial inaccessibility for employees who are compelled to resolve disputes through mandatory arbitration. These employees usually rely on unions and other methods of collective bargaining to realise their rights against their deep-pocketed and influential employers. In the United States, the sum of these factors has resulted in the regime operating in favour of employers. Employee arbitration claims are statistically less likely to succeed than claims brought before court and, even if the arbitration does succeed, the quantum of damages is significantly smaller than those awarded by courts. Thus, even lawyers are hesitant to take up employment claims arising from mandatory arbitration. Therefore, the cumulative effect of arbitration clauses is to curb employee claims all together and to silence any dissent at the workplace.   Judicial Position on Mandatory Arbitration Clauses in the US  Even though these clauses are restrictive and directly threaten employee rights, they have largely been upheld in the United States (US) since 1991 and have been broadened in scope by the judiciary. However, there have been legislative efforts in the recent past to undo their validity. The validity of mandatory arbitration clauses in employment disputes has been established in the US since the 1991 Supreme Court case of Glimer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane. The Federal Arbitration Act, 1925 provided that courts had to mandatorily enforce pre-dispute arbitration contracts with certain exceptions that included contracts of employment. The Court no longer saw it fit to afford this exception to employees in Glimer, stating that ‘little guy’ exception can no longer be availed by employees. This position was broadened in Epic Systems Corp v. Lewis wherein the Supreme Court, along with upholding the validity of one-on-one mandatory arbitration clauses, held that clauses prohibiting class action suits are legally permissible. There have been legislative attempts to curb the use of mandatory arbitration clauses. A law has already been enacted to ban mandatory or forced arbitration in sexual harassment cases. A wider legislation covering broader categories of disputes, titled ‘Force Arbitration Injustice Repeal (FAIR) Act’, is also being deliberated. It proposes to ban the enforcement of pre-dispute arbitration agreements entirely. While this Bill has been passed by the Democrat-led House of Representatives in March 2022, it is unlikely to garner support in the evenly divided Senate. While Republicans argue that such a bill would deprive workers of a cheaper and speedier alternative to court proceedings, the aforementioned arguments clearly suggest that these attributes are being used unfavourably against employees and the FAIR Act recognises these practical implications.    Arbitrability of Employment Disputes in India  While there is no official source stating whether such clauses are likely to be enforced in India, the issue can be evaluated by examining the current position of the courts on the arbitrability of employment disputes in India. Two different High Courts faced with the same question arrived at the conclusion that labour disputes should not be arbitrable. This question of the arbitrability of labour disputes first arose before the Bombay High Court in Kingfisher Airlines v. Captain Prithvi Malhotra and Others. This case dealt with the labour proceedings instituted by various staff members of the now non-operational Kingfisher Airlines for the recovery of unpaid wages and other salary benefits. While the staff instituted proceedings in the especially empowered labour courts, Kingfisher Airlines contested that the Court lacked jurisdiction because the employment agreement contained an arbitration clause. However, Kingfisher Airlines’ application for reference to arbitration was denied and the Labour Court retained jurisdiction over the proceedings. In the appeal, the Bombay High Court arrived at the same conclusion as the Labour Court, that is, labour disputes are not arbitrable under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The Court referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in Booz Allen and Hamilton v. SBI Home Finance which decided that the arbitrability of a claim must be determined by evaluating whether the claim is being asserted in personam or in rem. The Court held that the question of arbitrability must go beyond this consideration and evaluation whether the resolution of the claim must be specifically decided by a particular court or tribunal for public policy reasons. The Bombay High Court held that the adjudication of labour disputes has been reserved for Labour Courts under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (the ‘ID Act’) and the interpretation of the scheme of the ID Act reflects strong public policy reasons to support this conclusion. It also held that the ID Act provides for special modes of arbitration that allow collective labour disputes, and so any arbitration of labour disputes would have to be according to the specific provisions of the Act and not the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (the ‘A&C Act’) Five years later a similar question was raised in the High Court of Karnataka in Rajesh Korat v. Innoviti. Unlike in Kingfisher Airlines, the reference to arbitration was allowed by the Labour Court; however, in the appeal much of the reasoning of the Karnataka High Court resembled that of the Bombay High court. The Karnataka High Court also concluded that there were strong public policy reasons to allow the labour courts to have special and exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate industrial disputes matters. The Karnataka High Court, however, went beyond the reasoning of the Bombay High Court to hold that the ID Act is a self-contained body of law, and that the A&C Act has no application to matters falling within the ambit of the ID Act. It was also suggested that any arbitration of labour disputes would be in accordance with the ID act and not the A&C Act. These two judgements clearly identify the public policy ramifications of having employment disputes restricted to arbitration and stress on adherence to the norms and protections to the labour force afforded to them under the ID Act. What is also notable is that these judgements do not entirely discredit the use of arbitration in labour disputes but suggest that it be conducted in the specially designed format conceived under the ID Act that was adopted keeping in mind the public policy interests that the ID Act seeks to protect. While the Supreme Court is yet to adjudicate on the arbitrability of employment disputes and the legislature is yet to clarify this point of law, the judgements suggest that courts are generally likely to decide in the negative. Even though India emulates the Western markets when it comes to its strategies governing corporate affairs and has often been accused of diluting labour laws to improve its ranking on the Ease of Doing Business Index, the position of the courts suggests that is unlikely that mandatory arbitration clauses will be enforceable in India. Conclusion  While mandatory arbitration clauses seem like a threat to labour in India, it is unlikely that India will follow the same trajectory as the US in validating them. To uphold mandatory arbitration clauses is to violate the very spirit of arbitration and two High Courts in India have gone one step further and denied the application of arbitration to labour disputes altogether. Allowing arbitration in labour disputes in accordance with the spirit of the ID Act ensures that the benefits that arbitration provides as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism are reserved while the way it is conducted is labour-oriented. – Nankee Arora Arbitration Employment Law International Developments Labour Law"

        "read_on_content": [
            "PSUs and Competition Law in India: Balancing Public Interest and Market Efficiency By GuestAugust 4, 202312 Min readAdd comment   [Himanshi Yadav and Kartikey Baid are 4th Year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) students at National Law University, Jodhpur] In the contemporary era of interconnected global trade and commerce, the principles of free and  fair competition among not only private enterprises but also public and private sectors have become synonymous with a well-functioning free market. Consequently, the intersection of competition law and public sector undertakings (PSUs) in India necessitates careful consideration regarding equitable market competition between public and private companies. PSUs and competition law inherently exhibit discordance, as their underlying principles and objectives are inherently contradictory. PSUs are endowed with a wide array of benefits by the government to advance economic, social, and developmental goals, transcending the sole pursuit of profit. Conversely, competition law aims to eliminate any kind of undue and discriminatory benefits conferred upon any entity, irrespective of their intended motives, in order to establish a market free from obstacles impeding fair competition among private and public enterprises alike. It is noteworthy that the competition law in India, primarily governed by the Competition Act, 2002, does not provide for blanket exemptions to PSUs from its purview. Instead, it is the other governmental laws and policies, such as nationalization legislation, subsidies, preferential treatment in government procurement, and implicit guarantees of government backing, which create an environment conducive to unfair competition in the market. Consequently, the issue lies not with the competition law itself, but rather with the broader policies and market distortion caused by the government in the name of sovereign responsibility and the pursuit of the greater good. A notable argument raised by Coal India in a recent case also centered around the immunity provided to them from antitrust rules and regulations by the Coal Mines Nationalization Act, 1973 thereby implying an exemption to PSUs by the state. Advocates of PSUs primarily assert that these entities frequently operate in sectors critical to the nation’s development. Their primary objective extends beyond profit maximization to encompass the welfare of the public. However, this argument is weakened by the pervasive dilution resulting from the proliferation of PSUs across various sectors of the Indian economy, ranging from natural resources, textiles, transportation, and telecommunication to consumer goods and beyond. Moreover, these PSUs consistently enjoy the same discriminatory benefits across these sectors. Supreme Court’s Stance In its judgement rendered in June 2023, the Supreme Court addressed the question of whether the Competition Act applies to Coal India Limited (CIL) – a creation of the Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1973 – and its subsidiary Western Coalfields Limited as they are “geared and duty bound” to achieve the objects declared in Article 39(b) of the Constitution of India cannot be bound by the Competition Act, 2002. The top court’s judgment has come on Coal India Limited’s challenge to the December 2016 ruling of the then Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT) – whose role has now been assumed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) – which had dismissed its appeal against the October 2014 order of the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The CCI had held CIL guilty of abuse of its dominant position in the production and supply of non-coking coal to thermal power-producing plants in different states. The companies producing electricity from coal-fired power plants had objected to CIL increasing the coal prices from Rs. 1,631 per metric tonne to Rs. 2,177 per metric tonne. They had contended that the hike in price was without any justification and had imposed discriminatory pricing on buyers. Asking CIL to refrain from its anti-competitive practices, the CCI had imposed a penalty of Rs. 1733 crores on CIL. However, the same was reduced to Rs. 591 crores by the COMPAT, which remanded the matter back to CCI for fresh consideration. The three-judge bench of KM Joseph, BV Nagarathna and Ahsanuddin Amanullah, JJ rejected the contention of CCI and observed that: “If Parliament has intended that State monopolies even if it be in the matter of distribution must come under the anvil of the new economic regime, it cannot be found flawed by the Court on the ground that subjecting the State monopoly would detract from the common good which the earlier Nationalisation Act when it was enacted, undoubtedly, succeeded in subserving. We see no reason to hold that a State Monopoly being run through the medium of a Government Company, even for attaining the goals in the Directive Principles, will go outside the purview of the Act.” The Court explained that section 19(4) in fact empowers the CCI to have regard to “all” or “any” of the factors to arrive at the finding that an enterprise enjoys a dominant position or not. Section 19(4)(g) declares that “monopoly” or “dominant position”, whether acquired as a result of the statute or by virtue of being a government company or a PSU or otherwise, is to be a relevant factor. Hence, this is a clear indication that far from excluding governmental bodies like a government company, a PSU or a body under a statute from the purview of the Act, the lawgiver has evinced its intention to include government companies, public sector companies and bodies incorporated under a statute within the ambit of the Act. Government departments are also expressly covered within the expression “enterprise” under the Act. The Court explained that what is excluded from the definition of the expression “enterprise”, is a government department carrying on government functions. Hence, carrying on business in mining cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be described as a sovereign function. There is nothing in the definition which excludes a state monopoly which is even set up to achieve the goals in Article 39(b) of the Constitution. An International Perspective Professor Deborah Healey argues that state owned enterprises (SOEs) can harm competition more than private firms, because their behaviour “is likely to be more entrenched and more lasting”. Moreover, SOEs obtain benefits just because they belong to the government and many of them used to be monopolies running vital facilities. Taking an international perspective, we can find that countries such as Australia and EU already have a competitively neutral legal framework. We can take a look at the functioning of this practice in Australia to further understand its benefits as well as point out how we can adopt this approach in the most efficient way possible. The competition framework in Australia allows it to treat state-owned enterprises and private enterprises similarly, which means that state-owned enterprises should not enjoy any net competitive advantage over their private sector competitors simply by virtue of their public sector ownership. This principle was adopted as part of the National Competition Policy reforms that started in 1995, following the recommendations of the Hilmer Report in 1993. The reforms are aimed at enhancing the efficiency and productivity of the Australian economy by introducing more competition and market discipline in various sectors, including those dominated by state-owned enterprises. The competitive neutrality framework in Australia consists of several elements, including a legal and regulatory framework that ensures that state-owned enterprises are subject to the same taxation, regulation, debt guarantee and procurement rules as private enterprises, or that any differences are offset by appropriate payments or charges. It also includes a corporatisation process that transforms state-owned enterprises into separate legal entities with commercial objectives, independent boards and management, and clear performance and accountability standards among other such provisions that ensure competitive neutrality. Two key mechanisms that exist in Australia to further a better implementation of this approach are their public benefit test and complaints handling mechanism. The public benefit test allows for exemptions or modifications of competitive neutrality requirements if they are outweighed by the net benefits to the community from pursuing other public policy objectives. In addition to that, the complaint handling mechanism enables private enterprises or other interested parties to lodge complaints about alleged breaches of competitive neutrality by state-owned enterprises and to seek independent investigation and resolution by designated agencies at the Commonwealth or State level. This approach towards competition in Australia has improved the efficiency and performance of state-owned enterprises, as well as their private sector competitors, by reducing distortions and creating incentives for innovation and cost reduction. It has also enhanced transparency and accountability on behalf of state-owned enterprises and has also increased consumer welfare and social welfare by ensuring that prices reflect costs and quality and that public policy objectives are pursued in a more explicit and consistent manner. Possible Issues From This Decision Effect on FDI PSUs in India have historically held dominant positions in various sectors, limiting market access and competition for foreign companies. This can potentially deter foreign direct investment (FDI) as investors may perceive limited opportunities for growth and market entry. However, in recent years, there have been successful examples of foreign companies entering sectors previously dominated by PSUs. For instance, in the telecommunications sector, private and foreign companies have emerged as significant players, challenging the dominance of state-owned companies. This has resulted in increased competition, better services, and improved access to advanced technologies for Indian consumers. Influence Over Market PSUs often represent large and established companies operating in various sectors such as energy, banking, telecommunications, and infrastructure. The sheer market capitalization of PSUs, which stems out of financial reliance on governmental support instead of business activity, gives them and, by extension, the government considerable influence over the market. This poses a threat to the natural cycle of the market, which more often is used as a tool for market manipulation by the government, rather than a tool of growth for true private businesses. Public Sector Banks Public sector banks (PSBs), as government-owned entities, have historically held a dominant market position, accounting for a significant share of the banking sector. PSBs collectively hold a substantial market share in terms of deposits, loans, and branches. Their dominant position can limit competition by making it challenging for smaller banks or new entrants to gain market share. This concentration can reduce the number of players in the market and potentially stifle innovation and customer choice. Further, PSBs’ actions, including their lending and deposit rates, can influence market pricing. PSBs have access to government resources and preferential treatment, such as deposits from government agencies, public sector enterprises, and priority sector lending requirements. This can provide PSBs with a competitive advantage in terms of availability and cost of funds. The access to low-cost funds may enable PSBs to offer more favorable loan terms, potentially putting pressure on smaller banks or non-PSU banks to compete. The government’s policies and initiatives play a crucial role in shaping the competitive landscape of the banking sector. Reforms such as the merger of PSBs, recapitalization efforts, and increased focus on governance and transparency aim to strengthen PSBs and enhance their already unfair edge over private players. Preference to PSUs in Government Procurement The government is one of the largest consumers in any economy. When PSUs are given preference in government procurement, private players face barriers to entry or limited opportunities to participate in government contracts. This can restrict competition as PSUs enjoy preferential treatment in accessing government tenders and contracts, potentially reducing the number of private players involved in government projects. Further, this preference can also sometimes lead to a lack of transparency and accountability. This may result in limited visibility into the selection criteria, bidding process, and decision-making, raising concerns about fairness and integrity in the procurement process. Lack of transparency can erode trust and discourage private players from participating in government contracts. Challenge to MSMEs The unfair competitive advantage bestowed upon PSUs creates barriers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in accessing government contracts and markets. PSUs enjoy preferential treatment, resulting in unequal competition due to their larger scale, resources, and market reach. This creates an uneven playing field, limiting the ability of MSMEs to compete effectively. MSMEs face challenges in negotiating terms with PSUs, as the dominance of PSUs in government contracts reduces their bargaining power. Additionally, some MSMEs become overly dependent on PSU orders, making them vulnerable to disruptions caused by changes in procurement patterns. However, in recent times the government has started placing a selective quota for MSMEs in certain government procurements. This is a welcome start but more needs to be done to level the playing field. Conclusion In this post we examined the issue of competition law and PSUs in India, highlighting the inherent tension between the objectives and benefits of these entities and the principles of fair and free market competition. We also discussed the recent Supreme Court judgment that affirmed the applicability of the Competition Act to PSUs, rejecting the argument that they are immune from antitrust scrutiny by virtue of their statutory origin or constitutional mandate. Taking the example of Australia, which has adopted a competitive neutrality framework that ensures that PSUs and private enterprises are treated similarly and do not enjoy any net competitive advantage due to their public sector ownership, the post concludes by suggesting that India can learn from the Australian experience and adopt a similar framework that balances the social and economic goals of PSUs with the need to promote market efficiency and consumer welfare. Such a framework would not only enhance the credibility and legitimacy of PSUs, but also foster a more competitive and dynamic business environment in India. The post also provides some creative insights into the possible implications of this issue for various sectors and aspects of the Indian economy, such as foreign direct investment, market influence, public sector banks, and government procurement. It argues that PSUs can potentially harm competition more than private firms, because their behaviour is likely to be more entrenched and more lasting due to their government backing and benefits. It also points out some of the challenges and opportunities that arise from applying competition law to PSUs, such as ensuring compliance, addressing market distortions, enhancing consumer choice, and pursuing public interest objectives. The post thus offers a comprehensive and critical analysis of the complex and evolving relationship between competition law and public sector undertakings in India. – Himanshi Yadav & Kartikey Baid Competition Law Government Companies International Developments"

            "Unraveling SEBI’s Ex-parte Interim Orders: A Critical Analysis of the Zee Entertainment Case By GuestAugust 3, 20238 Min read1 comment   [Tanuj Sharma is a 5th year B.B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student and Vanshika Sharma is a 4th year B.B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student at National Law University Odisha] The Securities Appellate Tribunal (“SAT”) on 10 July 2023 upheld the decision of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) barring Subhash Chandra, the then Chairman of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. (“ZEEL”), and Puneet Goenka, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of ZEEL, from holding the position of a director or a Key Managerial Personnel (“KMP”) in any listed company or its subsidiaries until further notice. It was alleged that Subhash Chandra had signed a letter of comfort to Yes Bank Ltd. stating that a fixed deposit of Rs. 200 crores shall be available with Yes Bank for squaring off loans availed by the related entities of ZEEL. This was all done without informing, consulting and/or approval of the ZEEL Board. Thus, they were alleged to have violated regulation 4 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. As a result, the Whole Time Member (“WTM”) of SEBI issued an ex-parte interim order under sections 11 and 11B of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (“Act”) suspending Subhash Chandra and Puneet Goenka from holding any position as KMP. The SAT upheld this order and also directed SEBI to appoint another WTM to further investigate the case. In this post, the authors attempt to scrutinize the SEBI order which was upheld by SAT and substantiate how it creates a problem for the market and its stakeholders. Further, towards the end the authors propose why the idea of separation of powers within SEBI can be a step to tackle the problem created by the above-mentioned SEBI order. SEBI’s Power to Pass Ex-parte Interim Orders The objectives of the Act are to protect the interests of the investors in the securities market and its development. In consonance with these objectives is the scope of ex-parte interim orders passed under sections 11, 11B and 11D of the Act which allows SEBI to issue directions to realize these underlying objectives. These powers can be exercised either at the end of any enquiry or investigation or during its pendency. These powers include:  suspending the trading of any security in a recognised stock exchange; restraining persons from accessing the securities market and prohibit any person associated with securities market to buy, sell or deal in securities; suspending any office-bearer of any stock exchange or self- regulatory organization from holding such position; impounding and retaining the proceeds or securities in respect of any transaction which is under investigation; or attaching the property of the person who violated the provisions of the SEBI Act, rules, regulations, guidelines, circulars etc.  There has been a plethora of judgments where SEBI has passed ex-parte interim orders against listed companies which have been found to be engaged in insider trading or any other market frauds. An indispensable element across these orders has been the application of the principle of natural justice. This principle was further extended in Pancard Clubs Limited v SEBI where the SAT held that SEBI should exercise great care and caution in addition to following natural justice and fair play in action. Furthermore, in Dr. Udayant Malhoutra v. SEBI, the SAT upheld the three principles for granting an ex-parte interim order i.e. (i) there shall be a prima facie case made out against the person or party in question, (ii) the balance of convenience must lie in favor of passing the order as against abstaining from doing the same, and (iii) irreparable injury shall be caused if the order is not passed. The SAT further observed that merely by arriving at a prima-facie finding, SEBI cannot pass such orders without considering the balance of convenience and irreparable injury. Further, in Radford Global Ltd., SEBI issued a reasoned order taking into consideration that these three principles are satisfied. This shows that a due process shall be followed by SEBI while passing an ex-parte interim order. Problem with the SEBI Order In the present case, SEBI issued an ex-parte interim order relying solely on prima facie findings. However, it is noteworthy that in this order SEBI did not mention about the application of the principles of balance of convenience and irreparable injury, which are fundamental considerations in such matters. Subsequently, the SAT upheld the same order. Moreover, the SAT, in its judgment, did not provide justification for the application or non-application of the aforementioned principles. In addition, it is important to take into account that the prima facie findings in this case were strengthened by an order issued by SEBI in the matter of Shirpur Gold Refineries in which Puneet Goenka and Subhash Chandra were not parties to the dispute but certain entities associated in the present case were involved. It should be noted that both orders were passed by the same Whole Time Member (WTM). This raises concerns regarding the WTM’s potential reliance on his personal knowledge to reinforce the prima facie findings instead of relying solely on the material available on record, which was even acknowledged by the SAT while upholding the SEBI’s order. Even in cases like Networth Stock Broking Ltd. v. SEBI, Animish Pradip Raje v. SEBI and Sameer C. Arora v. SEBI it has been reiterated that SEBI shall only rely upon the material on record instead of imputing its personal bias. As a result, it appears that SEBI did not follow the laid down principles before issuing this ex-parte interim order, making it bad in law. The WTM suspended both Puneet Goenka and Subhash Chandra without passing a reasoned order which raises concerns regarding the exercise of power by SEBI while passing ex-parte interim orders. This shows the pressing need to exercise caution and keep a close eye on the powers of SEBI to pass ex-parte interim orders under section 11 of the SEBI Act. It is crucial to ensure a balanced approach that considers the potential repercussions on businesses and individuals involved, particularly when matters are still under examination and the final judgment is pending. Way Forward The abovementioned issues are associated with the lack of a clear separation of powers within SEBI, which functions as the executive, legislature, and judiciary, without sufficient checks and balances. As a result, many of the ex-parte interim orders passed by SEBI are reversed by the SAT and the Supreme Court. This problem was even highlighted by the Justice Sapre Committee constituted by the Supreme Court. According to the statistics in the committee’s report, a significant number of adverse orders passed by SEBI are prone to appeal before the SAT and the Supreme Court and if the order is set aside then it results in the sheer wastage of time, resources, and energy of the adjudicating arm of SEBI. In addition, such orders might even lead to an irreparable damage to the reputation of the directors or KMPs involved, if findings of the WTM are reversed by the appellate authorities. A possible solution to address these underlying problems within SEBI’s regulatory framework could involve separation of powers between its investigative and quasi-judicial arms. This approach would not only help resolve the present lack of checks and balances within SEBI but would also encourage the passing of orders based on material evidence on record as opposed to in the present case. SEBI can even draw inspiration from the regulatory practice of the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”), where the CCI effectively maintains transparency by separation of powers. Specifically, the CCI entrusts the Director General of Investigations with the responsibility of conducting thorough investigations within 60 days. Following the investigation, the Director General submits a status report to the CCI. This separation of powers ensures that the quasi-judicial arm of the CCI maintains a robust check and balance mechanism over the investigative arm. Conclusion  The present case comes as a setback for ZEEL and its investors as evidenced by the decline in its share price amid its merger with Culver Max Entertainment which may potentially erode investors’ confidence in the securities market. Therefore, if this case goes into appeal before the Supreme Court, the apex court should take into consideration the application of all the three elements required to be fulfilled to pass an ex parte interim order. Moreover, to further enhance the transparency of SEBI’s regulatory practice, it is crucial to adopt the doctrine of separation of power with segregated domains within SEBI. Following the CCI model for separation of powers shall also bolster confidence in the securities market by the stakeholders and will reduce the cases of unchecked exercise of power. – Tanuj Sharma & Vanshika Sharma SEBI Securities Regulation"

            "Evaluating SEBI’s Fit & Proper Test: Striking the Right Balance By GuestAugust 2, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Dhaval Bothra and Akshat Jain are law students at Symbiosis Law School Pune and National Law University Delhi, respectively] Trust remains the cornerstone in matters of public money, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) is the watchdog of this trust. In furtherance of this aim, almost two years ago, the SEBI introduced amendments to the “fit and proper rule” under the Intermediary Regulations, 2008, which provides for the “automatic disqualification” of stock market intermediaries and/or directors, promoters etc. This “automatic disqualification” is presently the subject of a challenge by the intermediaries before the Bombay High Court in a petition filed by various Indian stock brokers. The amended schedule II, clause 3 (“the Clause”) provides for the disqualification of stock market intermediaries on filing a criminal complaint or charge sheet in economic offences. It also mandates a prompt replacement of disqualified individuals within 30 days. Further, where a promoter or controlling interest holder fails to meet this “Fit and Proper” person criteria, they must abstain from voting rights and divest their holdings within six months of disqualification, or the intermediary faces disqualification. This article hypothesizes that while the regulator’s attempt is well-intentioned, SEBI falls short of free-market prudence. The article further provides a comparative analysis of other sectors involving similar financial integrity and risk considerations. It also undertakes a study of international practices. It concludes by emphasizing the need for a balanced regulatory framework that safeguards individual rights while ensuring market integrity. Myriad Regulators, Myriad Professions: No Automatic Disqualification The SEBI’s imperative to protect public money and uphold the financial system’s integrity often leads to far-reaching prescriptions. Bodies such as the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”), the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (“IRDAI”), and the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board of India (“IBBI”) have similar “fit & proper” criteria for public banks, insurers, and valuers respectively. However, no other regulator or profession presents such a far-reaching implication of an automatic disqualification based on a mere complaint, despite the common thread of public interest. Consider, for instance, the RBI which follows a post-conviction approach in appointing directors to public banks. The Master Direction – RBI (Fit and Proper Criteria for Elected Directors on the Boards of PSBs) Directions, 2019, read with section 22 of the State Bank of India Act, 1955, states that a person shall not qualify for a directorship of Central Board or membership of Local Board or committees if they have been removed or dismissed from the service of the government on a charge of corruption or bribery, or if they are or have been convicted of any offence involving moral turpitude. Therefore, directors are evaluated for their suitability only after legal proceedings and convictions, not before. Consider also the IRDAI, which prescribes a similar “fit and proper” criteria for the directors of insurers in its Guidelines for Corporate Governance. It mandates directors to have the necessary integrity and competence to uphold policyholders’ trust and ensure industry stability. They face disqualification only after a conviction and should have no prior convictions or adverse notices involving moral turpitude or any professional body. Moreover, due to pending criminal proceedings, the IBBI’s recent decision to disqualify a registered valuer has been stayed by the Bombay High Court, further bolstering its judicial standing. In India, under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, the Company Secretaries Act, 1980, the Companies Act, 2013, and the Advocates Act, 1960, disqualification occurs only upon conviction by a competent court for specific offences outlined within the respective acts. This approach aligns with the fundamental principle of “innocent until proven guilty”, ensuring that individuals retain their rights and liberties until a competent court finds them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In contrast, the SEBI’s “fit and proper” test has adopted a more stringent approach by considering mere complaints or charge sheets as grounds for disqualification. It is imperative to note that at the stage of the proposed disqualification, there is no conclusive determination of guilt. Individuals are yet to have the opportunity to defend themselves before any punitive action is taken, raising concerns about the fairness and proportionality of the “fit and proper” test against other regulators, which also have a similar goal. Global Comparative Framework: Protecting Capital Markets Consider, for instance, the law in the European Union (“EU”) prescribed under the Joint Guidelines issued by ESMA and EBA on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders under Directives 2013/36/EU and 2014/65/EU. These directives lay down a framework for evaluating the reputation, honesty, and integrity of individuals seeking registration as intermediaries. Unlike SEBI’s approach, annex 3 of the ESMA and EBA guidelines states that pending criminal proceedings are to be “taken into account” as criteria but not as automatic grounds for disqualification. This approach highlights the significance of conducting thorough assessments of an individual’s reputation and involvement in regulatory and enforcement proceedings. Similarly, in Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (“MAS”) Guidelines on Fit and Proper Criteriaemphasize honesty, integrity, and reputation as essential factors in assessing the suitability of a relevant person seeking registration as an intermediary. The MAS also considers pending criminal proceedings as criteria for evaluating an individual’s “fit and proper” status but not as automatic grounds for disqualification. This approach reflects a balanced regulatory framework that upholds market integrity while ensuring due process and fairness. In the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) also adopts a comprehensive approach to determine the honesty, integrity, and reputation of individuals under its Fit and Proper Test for Employees and Senior Personnel Handbook. Like the EU and MAS, the FCA considers pending criminal proceedings as criteria for evaluating a person’s “fit and proper” status but does not treat them as automatic grounds for disqualification. Additionally, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) released a Fit and Proper Assessment – Best Practice Report, where only a conviction record acts as a bar to intermediary registration. Despite being part of the IOSCO Board, the SEBI’s regulations do not align with these international standards. While the SEBI’s commitment to market integrity is commendable and well-intentioned, its automatic disqualification based on pending criminal proceedings without due process, fails the test of fairness and proportionality often laid down by the courts for regulatory interventions. Recommendations To strike a balance between upholding market integrity and safeguarding constitutional rights, certain crucial measures need to be adopted in the following manner:  Adopting the “Criteria for Assessment” approach: By adopting a “criteria for assessment” approach, SEBI’s “fit and proper” test can move away from automatic disqualification based on pending criminal proceedings. Instead, the committee can conduct a comprehensive evaluation, considering factors like track record, ethics, and cooperation with regulators. Transparent guidelines, procedural safeguards, and periodic reviews will ensure fairness and due process. This approach will also focus on harmonization with international standards. This will enhance market integrity, investor confidence, and global recognition. This approach strikes a balance, promoting India’s robust and trusted financial ecosystem. Applying the principle of proportionality: A paradigm shift from immediate disqualification to a principle of proportionality is essential. This ensures that the severity of alleged offences aligns with the corresponding penalties imposed. Concurrently, establishing an independent review mechanism becomes imperative to impartially assess disqualifications and provide affected parties with a fair platform to present their case. Formal hearings granted to entities before finalizing disqualification decisions will assure due process. Integrating international best practices of regions like the EU will create a transparent and constitutionally compliant regulatory framework, instilling investor confidence and attracting substantial investments to the corporate and business sector. Adopting a risk-based scoring system: The SEBI should adopt a dynamic and risk-based scoring system within its “criteria for assessment” approach, assigning numerical scores to factors like pending criminal proceedings, compliance history, and corporate governance practices. This model, employed in countries like the USA and recommended by IOSCO, quantitatively assesses risk profiles and allows periodic updates based on changing market conditions and new risk indicators. By utilizing data analytics and artificial intelligence tools, the SEBI can gain deeper insights into market participants’ behaviour, detecting patterns of non-compliance and suspicious activities more efficiently. This will enable the SEBI to prioritize regulatory efforts on higher-risk entities, enhancing market oversight and reducing the burden on compliant ones.  Conclusion Addressing the concerns arising from these violations is essential to mitigate potential impacts and foster a conducive investment climate which will promote the ease of doing business. Eliminating the risks of unwarranted disqualification will foster growth and progress in key sectors such as finance, technology, and infrastructure, making significant contributions to India’s overall economic development. A transparent and constitutionally compliant regulatory approach is required to instill investor trust and promote investments in India. Such an approach must uphold the principles of natural justice and equal protection of laws. The SEBI’s approach, while well-intentioned, falls short of fairness and proportionality concerns by being excessive. It does not align with international practices and seems a mere lip service to solving myriad investor concerns plaguing the Indian markets. By ensuring a fair and stable business environment, India can attract more investments and drive economic growth in the long run. – Dhaval Bothra & Akshat Jain Capital Markets International Developments SEBI"

        "title": "Digital Personal Data Protection Bill: Balancing Privacy and Innovation",
        "read_on_content": [
            "Digital Personal Data Protection Bill: Balancing Privacy and Innovation  By GuestJuly 30, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Ananya Karnwal and Astha Agarwal are 5th year B.A. LL.B (Hons.) students at National Law University Odisha in Cuttack, Odisha] Recently, on 5 July 2023 the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill (“The Bill”) received approval from the Central Cabinet. This Bill has been finalized after multiple attempts of the government to create a holistic legislation to govern digital data of individuals that is used by data fiduciaries and state for varied purposes. In November 2022, the Draft Digital Personal Data Protection Bill was brought in by the IT Ministry (“MeitY”) with a view to “framing out the rights and duties of the citizen (Digital Nagrik) on the one hand and the obligations to use collected data lawfully by the Data Fiduciary on the other.” The idea to have a legislation governing data privacy originally developed following from a historic ruling in 2017 (Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) & Anr. v Union of India & Ors), which recognized privacy of individuals as a right under Part III of Constitution. The government was directed to establish a law to protect citizens’ personal data from unauthorized use by both state and non-state entities. To address this requirement, the government formed a committee led by Justice B.N. Srikrishna to create a draft bill for protection of data. The committee completed its report and presented the first draft in form of the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2018. Subsequently, it was presented before the Lok Sabha after revision in 2019 as the PDP Bill. However, further scrutiny and public consultation were deemed necessary, so it was referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC). After conducting thorough examination and gathering public feedback, the JPC submitted its observations and findings, along with a modified draft bill which was named as the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill (DPDP). The Bill approved by the cabinet is the revised version of the 2022 Bill based on public consultation. Features Applicability Section 4(1) of the Bill specifies that it applies to all forms of transactions within India relating to personal data which is in digitized form. This includes two scenarios: (i)        when the data is collected online and (ii)       when the data is collected offline and subsequently digitized. Any processing of information pertaining to provision of goods or services in India which involves the data collection of any Indian individual has also been covered in section 4(2) of the bill. Personal data has been interpreted as any information that facilitates the identification of an individual. Processing, as defined in the Bill, refers to automated operations or a series of actions performed on digital personal data, encompassing activities such as collection, storage, usage, and sharing. However, according to section 4(3)(a), the Bill does not encompass the ‘non-automated’ processing of personal information, even if it exists in digital form. This means that a digitized record or document containing personal information on which automated data processing is not possible or not being carried out falls outside the scope of the Bill’s applicability. Additionally, concerning the processing of data for data principals located outside India, they were exempted from the obligations outlined in Chapter 2 of the Bill, specifically the obligations of a data fiduciary. This exemption applied if the processing of data was performed by an entity in India based on a contract executed with an entity outside India (as stated in section 18(1)(d)). Data Fiduciaries According to section  2(5), Data Fiduciaries under the Bill refer to “entities that carry out the collection, storage, or processing of personal data on behalf of individuals”. These entities bear the responsibility of ensuring the security and well-being of the data by preventing unauthorized access, misuse, or any form of harm. Section 7 of the Bill stipulates that Data Fiduciaries must obtain consent from individuals prior to collecting or processing their data, with a few exceptions of Deemed Consent provided under section 8, which includes cases related to state functions, legal obligations, emergencies, or public interest. The consent obtained must be free, based on acquainted understanding, particular of the intended purpose, clearly communicated, and capable of being revoked. Furthermore, section 9 of the Bill requires Data Fiduciaries to adhere to a set of principles while handling personal data. These principles include limitations on the purpose for which the data can be used, restrictions on the collection of data, ensuring data accuracy and quality, imposing limits on data retention, establishing accountability for data handling, and maintaining transparency in data processing activities. Data Protection Boards Section 19 covered under Chapter 5 of the legislation lays down the formation of a Data Protection Board (“The Board”) under which is vested with the responsibility of ensuring effective implementation and enforcement of the Bill. The Board will be established by the Central Government and will function as an independent body. The chairperson and other members of the Board will be considered as public servants and will be protected from legal proceedings for any actions taken by them in good faith under the provisions of the Bill. Majorly the Board will operate as a digital office which will ensure transparency and further allow it to perform its functions in a speedy, effective and seamless manner. The primary function as given in section 20 of the Bill is “to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Bill and address the complaints raised by various stakeholders”. To fulfill these functions, the Board has been entrusted with sufficient authority under section 21 to issue directions, conduct inquiries, impose penalties and take necessary actions to remedy data breaches or tranquilize any loss borne by the users. Section 22 specifies that “The Board may conduct proceedings under through individual members or groups while following the principles of natural justice, providing a reasonable opportunity for all parties involved to be heard”. Furthermore, the Board has the authority to issue interim orders to prevent non-compliance and may impose warnings or costs on complainants if a complaint lacks merit. By virtue of  section 21(13), all orders passed by the Board will be binding like that of a Civil Court making the existence of the Board worthy and effective. Data Principals As per section 2(6), Data Principal is defined as “the person with whom the personal data is associated”. The Data Fiduciaries are now required to take consent from the Data Principals before collecting their personal information. Section 12 and 13 enable the Data Principal to seek what information is being used by a Data Fiduciary and ask for corrections if required. Also, if they have any grievance then they can get it registered with the Data Fiduciary and if they further receive a dissatisfactory or no response, they can freely compliant before the Board. While exercising these rights, Data Principals must fulfill certain duties given under section 16, such as complying with applicable laws, avoiding false or frivolous grievances, and providing authentic information during correction or erasure requests. Challenges The objective of the legislation in safeguarding private data and holding data fiduciaries accountable. However, there are a few key concerns that may emerge in the future. The most concerning issue is the independence and accountability of the Data Protection Board. The fact that its members are appointed by the government raises doubts about their impartiality in overseeing data protection matters. This could undermine public trust and confidence in the data protection framework. Another challenge is the absence of a deadlines for various actions. For instance, there is no timeframe for deleting the collected data if the Data Principal wishes to withdraw consent. Similarly, the Bill lacks a specific timeline for the Board to adjudicate on complaints and for Data Fiduciaries to erase personal data once its intended purpose is served. Without clear and enforceable timelines, there is a lack of accountability and potential scope for abuse by Data Fiduciaries. Further, the Bill proposes severe penalties for noncompliance but lacks clear guidelines on what constitutes “significant” non-compliance. This subjectivity raises questions about fairness and consistency in enforcement. To address this, it is crucial for the legislature to define the threshold for significance, providing clarity on how penalties will be applied. Alternatively, the Board can issue contextual orders to ensure consistent and objective assessments based on specific situations. Another area of concern is that the Bill’s complex compliance regime presents challenges for SMEs, startups, and non-profit organizations. These entities may lack the resources and expertise to navigate the intricate requirements effectively. Complying with the Bill’s provisions can become a cumbersome task, diverting valuable time and resources from core business activities. The increased cost and administrative burden may hinder growth and discourage innovation, affecting the overall business environment in India. Conclusion The approval of the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill by the Union Cabinet marks a significant step towards safeguarding personal data and establishing a holistic legislation for preserving data in the country. However, as with any legislation, there are a few shortcomings that could act as a roadblock in ensuring its successful execution to protect the rights and privacy of individuals. While the Bill aims to protect personal data and hold Data Fiduciaries accountable, addressing the challenges mentioned above will be critical for its successful implementation. By ensuring the independence of the Board, establishing clear timelines, defining significant noncompliance, and considering the needs of smaller organizations, the legislation can strike a harmonious balance that protects individuals’ rights, encourages innovation, and supports economic growth. – Ananya Karnwal & Astha Agarwal Data Privacy International Developments"

            "Adducing Additional Evidence under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act By GuestJuly 27, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Raghav Bhatia is an Advocate practising at the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court. He can be contacted at [email protected].] Early this year, the Supreme Court of India in Alpine Housing Development Corporation Pvt. Ltd. v. Ashok S. Dhariwal reiterated that only in exceptional circumstances can a party adduce additional evidence under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Factual Background  Disputes arose between Alpine Housing Development Corporation Pvt. Ltd. and Ashok S. Dhariwal, which the parties referred to arbitration. The arbitral tribunal passed an ex-parte award dated March 12, 1998. As it was an ex-parte award, no evidence was led by Dhariwal before the arbitral tribunal. Aggrieved, Dhariwal preferred a petition under section 34 of the Arbitration Act. The award passed by the tribunal was for specific performance of the agreement and liberty was granted to apply for amalgamation of khatas. Under the award, it was Alpine Housing which had to apply for amalgamation of khatas. However, since Alpine Housing did not apply for amalgamation, Dhariwal had to apply twice for the same. The said applications, however, were rejected. During the pendency of the section 34 proceedings, Dhariwal filed an application for adducing additional documents. As the applications for amalgamation had been rejected, Dhariwal filed the aforesaid application for additional documents as it sought to “produce the final endorsement dated 17.03.2003 by which the prayer for amalgamation of khatas to plots were rejected”. Dhariwal wanted to place reliance on the said document to argue that the award was incapable of being executed and, thus, contrary to the public policy of India and liable to be set aside.  The application to adduce additional evidence was rejected by the court hearing the section 34 petition with the observation that “if such a permission is granted, it would defeat the object and purpose of early disposal of arbitration proceedings and it would delay further hearing of section 34 application”. For arriving at this decision, the court relied on section 34(2)(a) of the Arbitration Act which, after the 2019 amendment, allows the court to set aside an arbitral award if “the party making the application establishes on the basis of the record of the arbitral tribunal that…” one of the grounds mentioned in section 34(2)(a) of the Arbitration Act has been attracted. However, before the 2019 amendment, an award could be set aside where “the party making the application furnishes proof that…” one of the grounds mentioned in section 34(2)(a) has been attracted. Returning to the present case, aggrieved with the order rejecting the application for additional documents, Dhariwal preferred a writ petition before the Karnataka High Court. The High Court allowed the writ petition and set aside the order disallowing the application for additional documents. Accordingly, Dhariwal was allowed to adduce additional documents. Aggrieved, Alpine Housing has approached the Supreme Court in the present proceedings. Issue before the Supreme Court The sole issue before the Supreme Court was whether the party challenging an award under section 34 of the Arbitration Act can be permitted to adduce additional evidence. Proceedings before the Supreme Court At the outset, the Supreme Court observed that in the instant case since the award was passed by the arbitral tribunal in 1998, the same was way before the 2019 amendment came into force. Accordingly, the provisions of unamended section 34(2)(a) of the Arbitration Act would be applicable. After the aforesaid observation, the Supreme Court proceeded to determine whether an applicant can adduce additional evidence where the applicant is required to furnish proof under section 34(2)(a) of the Arbitration Act. Relying upon Fiza Developers and Inter-Trade Private Limited v. AMCI (India) Private Limited, Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. v. Girdhar Sondhi and Canara Nidhi Ltd. v. M. Shashikala, the Supreme Court observed that in an application under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, nothing “beyond the record that was before the” arbitral tribunal would be required. Cross examination of persons swearing the affidavits filed in the section 34 proceedings is not to be allowed “unless absolutely necessary”. This is so because, the Supreme Court observed, the proceedings under section 34 are in the nature of summary proceedings and an award can only be set aside on one of the grounds mentioned in sections 34(2)(a) and 34(2)(b) of the Arbitration Act. Further, issues are not required to be framed in section 34 proceedings as framing of issues and taking of oral evidence would defeat the objective behind the enactment of the Arbitration Act, i.e., speedy resolution of arbitral disputes. Although, in a section 34 proceeding, ordinarily nothing beyond the “record that was before the arbitrator” would be required, however, if there are certain issues which are not covered by the record before the arbitral tribunal, the same may be brought to the notice of the section 34 court by way of affidavits in exceptional circumstances. After the aforesaid discussion, the Supreme Court proceeded to consider whether the present case was an exceptional one or not. The Supreme Court noted that what Dhariwal wanted to place on record was the communication “by which the application for amalgamation of the plots is rejected”. As aforesaid, the arbitral tribunal in the instant case had passed an order for specific performance, the same being subject to the amalgamation of the plots. The Supreme Court concluded that the instant case fell under the category of “unless absolutely category” and that the High Court was right in permitting Dhariwal to adduce additional evidence. The Supreme Court observed that the “event of refusal to amalgamate the plots is subsequent to the passing of the award” and thus could not have formed part of the arbitral tribunal’s record. Further, the award was an ex-parte award and, thus, Dhariwal had no opportunity to lead evidence before the tribunal. Thus, the Supreme Court noted that an “exceptional case” has been made out by Dhariwal and he must be permitted to adduce additional evidence. At the same time, the Supreme Court held that Alpine Housing would also be given an opportunity “to cross – examine and/or produce contrary evidence”. Analysis  In the given facts of the case, the conclusion of the Supreme Court cannot be doubted. The order rejecting the permission for amalgamation went to the root of the dispute and the consequent arbitral award, and thus AS Dhariwal was rightly allowed to adduce the same before the court hearing the section 34 petition. Although it can be said that the Supreme Court missed an opportunity to discuss in detail the exceptional circumstances in which the courts can allow the parties to adduce additional evidence, a deeper scrutiny of the instant decision reveals two aspects which weighed with the Supreme Court while deciding the issue. First, as the award was for specific performance subject to amalgamation, since the application for amalgamation was rejected, the award was clearly liable to be set aside. Second, the document sought to be produced came into existence only after passing of the award, and thus, could not have been filed before the arbitral tribunal.   Given the scheme of the Arbitration Act which places emphasis on minimal judicial interference, the courts should allow an additional document to be taken on record only where such document sought to be adduced goes to the root of the dispute. Merely because a document might be relevant while deciding a section 34 application cannot be the standard. This is so because, otherwise, parties would seek to file additional documents routinely and argue how the same are relevant for deciding the section 34 petition. Further, if the document in question was available with the parties at the time of filing of section 34 petition, then the parties cannot be allowed to file the same belatedly. Such a high standard would prevent the parties from filing applications for additional documents routinely in section 34 proceedings. Further, the Supreme Court in the instant case was not required to analyse the impact of the 2019 amendment to section 34 of the Arbitration Act. Since the issue in the present case concerned around whether the award was in conflict with the public policy, the same is covered by section 34(2)(b) which uses the expression “the Court finds that”. Interestingly, following the 2019 amendment, the language used in section 34(2)(a) of the Arbitration Act is “establishes on the basis of the record of the arbitral tribunal that” and for section 34(2)(b) of the Arbitration Act the language used is “the Court finds that”. Therefore, the legislative intent suggests is that, in so far as grounds in section 34(2)(a) are concerned, they can be invoked on the basis of the documents on the arbitral record only. Therefore, a literal interpretation of the section 34(2)(a), following the 2019 Amendment, suggests that parties cannot file additional documents in section 34 proceedings which were not on the arbitral record. However, insofar as section 34(2)(b) is concerned, the language suggests that parties can rely on additional documents. Conclusion  With the issue of what constitutes an exceptional circumstance still not defined and delineated unambiguously, it will be interesting to see how the Supreme Court decides this issue going forward. It is hoped that the Supreme Court keeps the principle of section 5 of the Arbitration Act in mind and limit the circumstances in which additional documents can be filed. – Raghav Bhatia Arbitration Evidence"

        "read_on_content": [
            "Strengthening AIF Governance: SEBI’s Pro-Rata Proposal By GuestJuly 27, 20237 Min readAdd comment   [Sagun Modi is a 4th Year B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student at National Law University, Odisha] Alternative investment funds (‘AIFs’) have emerged as vital investment vehicles in the global financial landscape. They provide investors with diversified investment opportunities beyond traditional asset classes. India witnessed a 30% increase in investment commitments into AIFs, from Rs. 6.41 trillion in the financial year 2021-22 to Rs. 8.33 trillion in the financial year 2022-23, up by Rs. 1.92 trillion. With the growth of the AIF industry, regulatory authorities have been diligently addressing concerns related to investor protection, transparency, and equitable treatment within these investment structures. Against this backdrop, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’) released a consultation paper dated 23 May 2023 to solicit public feedback on a proposal concerning the pari-passu and pro-rata rights of investors in AIFs. The issuance of this consultation paper was prompted by the AIF industry’s request for the introduction of a distinct class of units for co-investment alongside AIF investments. However, SEBI rejected this request while explaining that investors in an AIF possess rights in each AIF investment proportionate to their contribution in the AIF, commonly known as pro-rata rights. Also, SEBI underscored the significance of fair and equitable treatment by proposing that an AIF should treat its investors on a pari-passu basis, meaning they should be treated equally in terms of their economic rights. In this post, I aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the consultation paper issued by SEBI and examine the proposal as well as the recommendations put forth by the working group, in relation to the pro-rata and pari-passu rights of investors of an AIF. Moreover, I will explore the potential impact of these proposals and recommendations on the pro-rata distribution rights of investors, within the framework of broader corporate governance principles. The Regulatory Concerns and Proposed Changes Presently, a prevailing practice observed within the realm of AIFs is the preservation of pro-rata rights among investors in each investment made within the AIF scheme, encompassing the distribution of investment proceeds. Furthermore, a SEBI circular dated 19 June 2014 specified the following: “With respect to investment by the sponsor/manager in the  AIF,  the sharing of loss by the sponsor/manager shall not be less than pro-rata to their holding in the AIF vis-à-vis other unit holders”. This indicates the regulatory intent to maintain the pro-rata rights of investors, including during the distribution of investment proceeds. However, SEBI’s examination revealed that specific schemes of AIFs have implemented a distribution waterfall mechanism that segregates investors into distinct classes or tranches, leading to a differential allocation of investment proceeds concerning these investor classes. This differential treatment results in a situation where the junior class of investors bears losses disproportionately higher in relation to their holdings in the AIF compared to the senior class of investors. The reason behind this inequitable allocation stems from the senior class of investors enjoying priority in the distribution of proceeds over the junior class, giving rise to what is commonly referred to as a priority distribution model (‘PD Model’) among the investors. As implemented by select AIFs, the PD model entails a specific compensation mechanism that operates in both losses and profits. In the event of a loss scenario, the PD model ensures that the senior class of investors are compensated for their losses from the residual capital of the junior class’ investors. Conversely, when a profit scenario arises, the distribution of profits follows a predefined order wherein the senior class of investors receives their share of profits until their hurdle rate is met. Subsequently, any surplus amount remaining after meeting the senior class’s hurdle rate is allocated to the junior class of investors. It was brought to SEBI’s attention that AIFs adopting the PD model were structured to take advantage of the regulatory arbitrage with respect to compliance with other regulatory requirements. This arbitrage arose due to the lack of an express prohibition on the disproportionate sharing of losses among different classes of investors. It was observed that such structuring of AIFs had the potential to facilitate the ever-greening of loans extended by regulated lenders. By subscribing to the junior class of investors, these lenders could effectively incur a reduction in returns from the AIF. The application of the PD model raised concerns about the emergence of conflicts of interest among different classes of investors, as each class may possess varied risk appetites while investing in the same entity. As a consequence, there was a heightened risk of mis-selling, as investors found it challenging to accurately assess the potential risks associated with their investments. With this backdrop in place, the Alternative Investment Policy Advisement Committee (‘AIPAC’) put forth a recommendation to establish a Working Group tasked with addressing regulatory concerns and proposing mechanisms to safeguard the priority distribution of proceeds amongst investors. In response to AIPAC’s recommendation, SEBI advocated the discontinuation of the PD Model and stressed the necessity of explicitly incorporating provisions in the AIF regulations that mandate the maintenance of pro-rata rights for investors in all AIF investments. Recommendations of the Working Group The Working Group recommended that the PD Model should not be totally outlawed, but rather checks and balances should be in place to mitigate the risks of any misuse. Also, the PD model should be disallowed only in select circumstances when such safeguards are considered insufficient to prevent the misuse. The recommendation entails permitting the PD model under specific circumstances, subject to the fulfilment of two essential conditions. Firstly, the AIF must be established through the acquisition or refinancing of assets belonging to an unrelated third party. Secondly, the limited partners should not have any affiliations with the entities from whom the assets are being acquired/refinance, either directly or indirectly. However, an exception is made, allowing the contributor of the assets to hold up to 10% of the AIF units. SEBI, in its response to the recommendations, expressed its disapproval and instead advocated for a distinct approach regarding the rights of investors in AIFs. SEBI’s proposed framework entails two fundamental principles: (a) The rights of each investor within the AIF scheme should be maintained in proportion to their respective commitments to the scheme during the investment phase, as well as during the distribution of proceeds from the investment. This is what is known commonly as the ‘pro-rata rights’ of investors, and; (b) All investors participating in the AIF or its specific schemes should be treated equitably concerning their economic rights. However, it noted that this provision would not be applicable in cases where differential rights are granted based on terms related to the hurdle rate of return, performance-linked fee or additional return, and management fees. SEBI’s proposed regulatory framework aims to reinforce transparency, integrity, and investor confidence within the AIF structures, in alignment with overarching principles of corporate governance. The proposal carries significant implications for the junior class of investors, as it seeks to address the issue of concentration of power that may arise in favour of the senior class of investors concerning the distribution of investment proceeds. By advocating the maintenance of pro-rata rights of investors in each investment of the scheme, the proposal serves as a pivotal mechanism to mitigate potential imbalances of power between different classes of investors. Moreover, the proposal effectively curtails the predominant influence of the senior class of investors, thus promoting a level playing field among all investors within the AIF structure. The preservation of pro-rata rights emerges as a fundamental and distinctive characteristic of the proposal, aligning with the core objectives of the AIF framework. This measure is designed to foster equitable treatment and fair allocation of benefits, reinforcing the principles of corporate governance and bolstering investor trust in the AIF industry. By mitigating the possibility of undue concentration of power, SEBI’s proposal contributes to a more robust and investor-friendly AIF ecosystem, fostering greater confidence and participation among investors across all classes. Conclusion Striking the right balance between investor rights, managerial autonomy, and industry competitiveness will be crucial in ensuring the successful implementation of the proposed measures for the AIF framework. Given that India is slowly becoming a popular investment destination across the globe, regulatory concerns should not hinder such investments into the country. As proposed by SEBI, maintaining the pro-rata rights of investors within the AIF framework is also in line with global best practices. This would benefit the entire AIF industry as a whole. – Sagun Modi Alternative Investment Funds SEBI"

        "read_on_content": [
            "Commercial Wisdom of the Committee of Creditors: An End to Excessive Deference? By GuestJuly 26, 20236 Min read2 comments   [Mathanki Narayanan is a 4th year B.A. L.L.B. (Hons.) student at Jindal Global Law School] The conceptualization of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) was underpinned by the need to preserve economic value through expediency. However, its implementation has revealed asymmetries of power amongst the creditors. The Committee of Creditors (CoC) spearheads the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), effectively taking over the reins from the erstwhile Board of Directors of the debtor-company. Comprised entirely of financial creditors, the CoC’s decisions in respect of the fate of the corporate debtor have consistently been upheld by Adjudicating Authorities in the guise of upholding its “commercial wisdom”. This post attempts to briefly examine the growth of this deference and scope for change in light of the recent judgment in the case of M.K. Rajagopalan v. Dr. Periasamy Palani Gounder. Tasked with the responsibility of helping the corporate debtor get back on its feet, the CoC may either seek profitable resolutions from the market (with or without a haircut on claims of any or all of the stakeholders) or, as a last resort, proceed with liquidation. The decision as to whether or not the corporate debtor is to be eased back into business or liquidated is left to the COC- as a fundamentally “business” decision. There is little doubt that upholding commercial wisdom will hasten the CIRP/liquidation process. However, the question to be asked here is- at what cost? The CoC comprises only financial creditors; operational creditors are consequently relegated to a position that leaves them ill-equipped to claim their dues or even adequately participate in the processes which might otherwise allow them to do so. Although the Supreme Court (SC) in Essar Steel India v. Satish Kumar Gupta emphasized that the CoC must account for the interests of all stakeholders while finalizing a resolution plan, the absence of any concrete delimitation of the CoC’s powers puts those classes of creditors who are not part of the CoC at a disadvantage. The increasing prevalence and magnitude of haircuts (albeit an improvement from pre-IBC days) could lead to more difficulties for creditors, particularly operational creditors. For instance, in the insolvency proceedings of Videocon Industries Ltd., the claims of the secured financial creditors took a haircut of approximately 96%, while the claims of operational creditors took a haircut of around 99%. Furthermore, because the IBC is a relatively new legislation, judicial interpretation and innovation play an important role. In this context, judicial deference in the form of an unquestioning commitment towards upholding the commercial wisdom of the CoC is dangerous not just vis-à-vis the corporate debtor itself but also in terms of its implications for the wider economy. An array of judgements, from K Sashidhar v. Indian Overseas Bank to Gail India v. Ajay Joshi, have consistently upheld the substantial powers bestowed upon the CoC. Although it can be said that judicial scrutiny inhibits the unbridled use of these powers, the fact remains that there is not much in the way of a comprehensive judicial review to hold the CoC accountable for its oversight. The case of Kalpraj Dharamshi v. Kotak Investment Advisors is particularly important in this regard, as it addressed the issue of conflict between the CoC and the Adjudicating Authority vis-à-vis approval of resolution plans. The SC stated that such commercial wisdom is not to be interfered with except in accordance with the grounds delineated in sections 30 and 61 of the IBC. According to these sections, a resolution plan may be challenged for contravening any law, not conforming to the Board’s requirements, having material irregularity in the exercise of the resolution professional’s powers, etc. The SC also upheld the primacy of the CoC, stating that it is the best judge of the feasibility of a resolution plan by virtue of its commercial wisdom. On 3 June 2023, the SC even approved a 93.5% haircut in the settlement amount by quashing the NCLAT’s order for liquidation in the case of Vallal Rck v. Siva Industries and Holdings. However, the SC has taken a small but encouraging step in the right direction by limiting the freedom of the CoC in Rajagopalan. Since the submission of the resolution plan was in contravention of Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act, the SC held unequivocally that the commercial wisdom of the CoC should not be “over-expanded to brush aside a significant shortcoming in the decision making of CoC when it had not duly taken note of the operation of any provision of law for the time being in force.” In this case, the commercial wisdom of the CoC was questioned with respect to multiple aspects of the insolvency process (such as the ineligibility of the resolution applicant, as well as the failure to place the resolution plan before the CoC). However, the Court held the CoC accountable in a very constrained manner. While factors such as the ineligibility of the Resolution Plan (given its contravention of Section 88) did not necessarily form part of the CoC’s consideration, the SC also held that the status of the CoC would not be a sufficient reason to ignore such shortcomings. Furthermore, commercial wisdom is accorded a status of primacy in the CIRP- subject to the condition that every aspect of the Resolution Plan is made available for the CoC’s deliberation.  Given that the IBC itself has been designed in such a way that the claims of financial creditors take precedence over the claims of operational creditors, the limited grounds for challenging commercial wisdom as enshrined in Sections 30 and 61 are woefully inadequate to do anything beyond curbing obvious excesses of power and ensuring legal compliance. Perhaps this form of excessive reliance on the CoC’s decision will fulfill- in a myopic sense- the goals of the IBC, i.e., speedy resolution of insolvency. But as time passes, careful heed must be paid to how the IBC truly commits to collective involvement and equal rights of all creditors. The SC, instead of enumerating a broader framework to challenge the liberties of the CoC, has effectively upheld its commercial wisdom yet again, but this time with the important caveat that it cannot be used as an excuse to turn a blind eye to its shortcomings. Commercial wisdom is affirmed subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions, such as thorough consideration of the final resolution plan, the availability of relevant information, and so on. Therefore, despite this judgment marking a turn in the trend of simply relying on the CoC, it is limited. This post argues that the actions of the CoC must be evaluated against a standard laid down in a comprehensive code of ethics and not merely the limited grounds mentioned in the IBC itself. While the IBBI has acknowledged the need for formulating a draft Code of Conduct, authorities would be well-advised to bear in mind the economic and legal implications of granting unrestrained powers to the CoC. It also remains to be seen whether this judgement will inspire a judicial trend of decreasing deference to the commercial wisdom of the CoC. – Mathanki Narayanan Insolvency"

        "title": "Game On, Taxes Doubled: Unraveling the Dual Taxation Conundrum in India’s Online Gaming Industry: Part II",
        "read_on_content": [
            "Game On, Taxes Doubled: Unraveling the Dual Taxation Conundrum in India’s Online Gaming Industry: Part II By GuestJuly 26, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Rupam Dubey and Parth Kantak are 3rd-year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) students at the National Law School of India University, Bangalore This is a continuation of Part I] The preceding segment of this post examined the taxation framework enforced upon the realm of online gaming in India and the dual taxation regime of the Union Government which leads to a situation of double taxation, imposing an unfair burden on the gaming industry. In this section, we will delve into two specific aspects. First, we will examine tax structures implemented in jurisdictions having the most prominent online gaming markets, aiming to ascertain the international exemplars of optimal tax practices within this domain. Second, we explore the advantages that accrue to the Indian ecosystem from the assimilation of these international best practices, as well as the adverse consequences that may flow from their neglect, employing a method akin to cost-benefit analysis. Comparative Analysis of Tax Practices and Rates in Jurisdictions Worldwide: A Comprehensive Examination The introduction of taxation on online gaming in India is a recent development, and the income tax authorities have been consistently providing clarifications to assist the industry in calculating taxes. Considering that the online gaming industry is projected to reach $8.5 billion by 2027, it holds the potential to contribute to the country’s GDP and support India’s goal of becoming a trillion-dollar digital economy by 2026. Therefore, any alterations to the tax structure should be sustainable to foster positive growth. Inappropriate policy signals could hinder or even devastate this emerging industry. To ensure a balanced approach towards promoting the online gaming industry while preventing tax evasion, we examine successful international jurisdictions. For example, in the United States, the regulations pertaining to online gaming differ based on the policies of individual states. Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) operates under the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) of 2006, which categorises fantasy sports as games of skill rather than gambling. As a result, DFS winnings are considered taxable income, and an excise tax of 0.25% is applied to the entry amount. If a user’s winnings surpass a specific threshold (e.g., $600), the platform may issue a 1099-MISC tax form, which is an Internal Revenue Service form which is used to report certain kinds of miscellaneous compensation. Regarding online games of skill like poker and rummy, a standard income tax rate of 24% is applied to both online and offline casino games in the US. Similarly, in the UK, online gaming operators, including skill-based platforms, are subject to Remote Gaming Duty (RGD). RGD is a tax imposed on the gross gaming yield (GGY), which represents the amount remaining after deducting the winnings paid to customers from the total stakes received. The current rate of RGD is 21% for games of chance, making it comparable to TDS in India. In the UK, online poker and rummy games are considered forms of gambling. Individuals who win money from gambling activities, including online poker and rummy, are generally not subject to tax. This applies to both professional and recreational players. However, the platforms where the bets are placed are taxed at a rate of 25%, regardless of whether they are domestic or foreign. The taxation of fantasy games in the UK depends on whether they are considered gambling activities. Since gambling activities are not taxed in the UK, if fantasy games are classified as gambling, they are not subject to taxation. Additionally, Australia, known for its active gambling and sports betting markets despite its relatively small population, has specific laws governing online gambling. The Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (Cth) and Interactive Gambling Amendment Act 2017 (Cth) were enacted to regulate online gambling activities. These laws prohibit online gambling contests that combine chance and skill, offer cash prizes, require entrance fees, or involve bets among participants on online platforms. However, an exemption is made for betting on “sports events” to accommodate Australian onshore betting operators. In Italy, the tax regime applied to online gambling is profit-based. The tax rates are 20% for games of skill (including poker tournaments) and casino games, card games (including poker) and bingo, and 22% for sports betting, which can include fantasy sports. Italy holds significance as it currently ranks as the fourth largest market globally and the second largest in Europe. Considering these international frameworks, it is evident that other countries either have a single taxation system or a dual taxation system, where the effective tax rate does not exceed 40%. Furthermore, it is important to note that the tax imposed in these countries is based on the Gross Gaming Revenue, which includes platform fees. In contrast, in India, the tax is imposed solely on the prize pool. This effectively raises the tax rate to up to 55% compared to the pre-GST regime. Additionally, the GST applied to online gaming is levied on the consideration paid by a player, which further adds to the prize pool. Therefore, not only is the tax rate high in India, but the multiple taxes imposed on the industry are based on the same object – the prize pool. This results in dual taxation and an unfair burden on the industry. Implications of a Favorable Tax Policy in India: Necessity for a Change in Tax Policy in Relation to Online Gaming The tax structure in India can be divided into two components: a TDS of 30% and a GST of 28%. The flaws of this tax structure, particularly the issue of double taxation and the unsustainability of applying GST, have been discussed in the previous section. Not only does the tax structure pose problems, but also deviates from international best practices. The jurisdictions examined earlier, primarily apply income tax rates ranging from 20% to 25%. They do not have tax rates that exceed this range, nor do they impose GST, let alone follow a policy of double taxation. This disparity disincentivises Indian businesses from operating within the country. Moreover, since the burden of such taxes would be passed on to consumers, it would also discourage consumers from participating in online gaming, or drive them towards unregulated offshore betting platforms, as explained later in this post. Therefore, such a high tax rate would hinder the growth of the Indian industry. Furthermore, a higher tax rate discourages small innovators and businesses from introducing new ideas and expanding the scope of the field since the high tax rate eats into the limited capital with which these businesses typically start. Such a situation contradicts one of the objectives of the Government in making amednments to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code), 2021 to include online gaming, which is to encourage innovation. The high tax rate indicates a certain reluctance on the part of the Government to create favourable tax policies. Despite positive intentions, the negative impact would be felt by small innovators and businesses, preventing the democratisation of the industry and leading to dominance by market leaders who possess greater capital and market share. While a higher tax rate may result in increased revenue for the Government in the form of taxes, the adverse effects on the industry could gradually reduce tax revenue. By hindering industry democratisation and restricting its expansion, the Government would receive less revenue. Therefore, although the Government may initially generate significant revenue in the short term, it would ultimately be at a disadvantage in the long run. Another consequence of a high tax rate would be consumers gravitating towards more profitable alternatives, such as offshore unregulated betting agencies that evade taxes. Since these companies themselves evade taxes, they do not pass on the tax burden to the consumers. Consequently, consumers can take home a larger portion of their winnings compared to a regulated setting with a high tax rate. The Government has already recognised this issue and taken measures by issuing advisories against advertising online betting platforms, as advertisements are a means through which they become accessible to the general public. However, if the Government fails to actively address this problem by implementing an appropriate tax policy, it is likely to exacerbate. Considering these factors, it is imperative for India to revise its tax policy regarding online gaming. Conclusion: The Way Forward In conclusion, it is clear that India needs to change its tax policy in relation to online gaming, and we put forth three key recommendations in this regard. First, it is crucial to adjust the TDS rate to an optimal level, which falls within the range of 20-25%. As highlighted earlier, India’s current TDS rate is significantly higher than that of other countries. Lowering the TDS rate would align with international best practices and create a favorable environment for the industry. Additionally, applying the tax on the Gross Gaming Revenue, as argued in Part I, would be a more reasonable approach. Second, it is advisable to eliminate the application of GST. Following international best practices, India should refrain from imposing GST on online gaming. This step would help avoid issues related to double taxation and other negative consequences that were outlined in the previous section. Third, addressing concerns related to addiction and other social issues should be approached through technical solutions rather than solely relying on high tax rates. While the Government’s intention to prevent excessive addiction is valid, a high tax rate alone is not an adequate solution. Implementing technical measures such as raising awareness about the risks of excessive gaming, setting limits on betting amounts based on players’ losses and other relevant factors, implementing age restrictions, and other suitable strategies would be more effective in tackling addiction. These technical solutions should be thoroughly examined and implemented by the appropriate Government agencies. However, it is important to note that while these solutions would help address addiction, combining them with a higher tax rate could hinder the industry’s growth. Therefore, a careful balance is needed. By adopting these recommendations, India’s tax policy can be optimised, fostering industry growth and generating significant revenue for the Government.

            "Game On, Taxes Doubled: Unraveling the Dual Taxation Conundrum in India’s Online Gaming Industry: Part I By GuestJuly 25, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Rupam Dubey and Parth Kantak Mangrish are 3rd-year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) students at the National Law School of India University, Bangalore] The emergence of affordable internet in India has had a profound impact on the country’s mobile gaming industry. With increased accessibility to the internet, more people have been able to engage in online gaming, resulting in India becoming one of the largest mobile gaming markets worldwide. This growth is projected to continue, with an estimated increase of $8.5 billion in the market by 2027. Given the substantial growth and economic significance of the online gaming industry, the Union government has recognised the need to address taxation in this sector. The measures of the government seek to ensure that appropriate taxes are levied on gaming activities while also preventing tax evasion and ensuring fairness. To this end, the Finance Bill of 2023 introduced a significant change in the taxation of online gaming winnings. Previously, a threshold of Rs 10,000 was established for Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) purposes, meaning that tax was deducted when winnings exceeded this amount. However, the new amendment replaced this threshold with a flat 30% tax on the net winnings from online gaming platforms. This change aims to simplify the taxation process and ensure that taxes are paid on all significant winnings. In addition to the changes in direct taxation, amendments were also made to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) applicable to winnings from these gaming platforms. Games of chance, such as those primarily based on luck or random outcomes, are now subject to 28% GST, while games of skill, which require a certain level of expertise and strategy, are subject to 18% GST. This distinction recognises the varying nature of different types of games and their associated tax implications. However, in the recent GST Council meeting, based on the second report of the Group of Ministers, the GST Council decided to levy a uniform 28% tax rate regardless of the nature of the game. This increases the burden on the gaming industry since now the distinction between the game of skill and chance and the effective difference in their taxation rate is extinguished. This increases the concerns that have been raised regarding the potential double taxation of the same prize pool. This post argues that the combination of income tax on net winnings and the GST on the prize pool can result in a situation where the same funds are subject to multiple tax burdens. This could impose a significant financial burden on the gaming industry and potentially discourage its growth. To address these concerns, this post looks at international legal precedents. By examining how other countries have dealt with similar challenges, it proposes a balanced solution that considers the interests of both tax authorities and the gaming industry. The aim is to develop a taxation framework that effectively prevents tax evasion while also ensuring that the gaming industry is not unfairly burdened by excessive taxation. The Indian Taxation Maze: Unveiling the Framework and Consequences of Dual Taxation On December 23, 2022, the Government of India introduced the Government of India (Allocation of Business) (370th Amendment) Rules 2022, assigning matters related to online gaming to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). Consequently, MeitY issued the Draft Information Technology Rules 2023, which proposed a lightly regulated framework aligned with Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. These rules required the establishment of a Self-Regulated Body (SRB) to act as a quasi-judicial entity responsible for certifying and registering every game with the Government, as well as providing clarifications on related matters. The objective behind these initiatives was to bring clarity to tax administration by determining the applicable tax rates for different games. The Ministry of Finance promptly announced a 30% tax on the net winnings from online gaming platforms as Tax Deducted at Source (TDS), under Section 194BA of the Income Tax Act, 1961. This decision eliminated the previous minimum threshold of Rs 10,000 for TDS purposes. This development raised the question of whether GST should be levied on online gaming and, if so, at what rate? The decision of the 50th GST council meeting compounds the problem further, wherein there will now be a uniform 28% tax that will be levied on the gaming industry as a whole. It could be argued that this resolves the problem of self-regulating bodies deciding whether a game is game of skill or chance to decide the tax rate (which became a contentious issue in the Gameskraft case). However, such an argument does not account for the steep burden that is imposed on the gaming industry. Additionally, the Government stated that the tax would be imposed on the platform fee, or the consideration paid by players. However, this approach raises concerns that taxing the platform fees equates to taxing the prize pool, as the consideration paid by players ultimately contributes to the prize pool. A similar argument was used in Gurdeep Singh Sachar v Union of India, where it was determined that the amount pooled in the escrow account constitutes an actionable claim and is taxable under entry 6 of schedule III, section 7(2) of the Central Goods and Services Act, 2017 (CGST Act). It could however be suggested that rule 31A (3) of the CGST Act is not applicable, as actionable claims cannot be considered a supply of goods or services and should be exempt from GST. However, this counterargument falls flat when one  notes that schedule III, section 7 of the CGST Act, 2017 permits the taxation of such actionable claims, making rule 31A (3) of the CGST Act introduced by an amendment act under section 9 of the CGST Act in 2018 ultra vires of the said statute itself, as it is not consistent with other sections of the same act. In summary, TDS is now applicable at a rate of 30% on net winnings or the prize pool, and GST is also applicable at 28%, on the gaming industry. This creates the issue of dual taxation, placing an unfair burden on the emerging gaming industry in the country. To simplify, consider an example of Game A, which is a game of skill, and a player X who plays it. If player X wins Rs 500, the applicable taxes would be 30% TDS and 28% GST. Applying 28% GST to the net winnings of Rs 500, the GST amount would be approximately Rs 140, leaving Rs 360 as the taxable amount. However, under the current framework, TDS is applied to the entire prize pool of Rs 500 (resulting in Rs 150 as TDS). This leads to dual taxation, unfairly burdening the gaming industry. Industry Disruption: Unveiling the Impact and Consequences of Transformational Changes The high tax rates implemented by the Union Government create incentives for users to shift to offshore and grey market operators who evade taxes in India. This will result in significant tax revenue leakage amounting to billions of rupees. One counterargument could be made using Section 12 of the Integrated Goods and Services Act, 2017 (IGST Act), which states that imported services are subject to taxation if the place of supply is within India’s jurisdiction. Additionally, the proviso to Section 14(2) of the IGST Act places the responsibility on offshore Online Information Data Base Access and Retrieval (OIDAR) service providers to appoint a person to pay integrated tax. However, this approach falls short, as offshore betting and gambling platforms have not appointed any local representatives in India who are registered to pay taxes on their behalf. Furthermore, these companies have not even applied for registration under the Simplified Registration Scheme in Form GST REG-10. This indicates a tendency of tax evasion on the part of offshore companies, rendering the use of Section 12 of the IGST Act ineffective. To provide context, a report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry in 2013 highlighted that betting and gambling in India amount to INR 300,000 crore and result in revenue leakage ranging from INR 12,000 crore to INR 19,000 crore in 2013. This results in substantial loss of revenue to the Government. Furthermore, under the pre-GST regime, online gaming was treated differently. For example, service tax was imposed on the Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) rather than the prize pool, as per the Service Tax Act, 1994. However, the operations of such platforms have not fundamentally changed, and the online gaming industry’s legitimate expectation is to have certainty in terms of tax payment, similar to what they have been paying for the past decade. Moreover, countries like the US, UK, and Australia  levy GST only on GGR or platform fees. Therefore, any change in the tax regime would burden the industry with additional taxes, potentially creating an unsustainable market and forcing many small operators to exit. This would adversely impact revenue growth in the long run, potentially leading to the industry’s demise. In light of these concerns, we propose that India should examine international best practices to strike a balance between preventing revenue leakage and promoting the growth of the emerging online gaming industry. The second part of the post will explore international legal precedents to argue for a sustainable tax rate that balances competing interests and avoids dual taxation of the online gaming industry.

            "SEBI Circular on ESG Disclosures of Value Chains: A Double-Edged Sword By GuestJuly 22, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Avani Hegde and Praneel Panchagavi are 3rd year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) students at Symbiosis Law School, Pune] The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a circular on July 12, 2023 notifying the mandate for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures and assurance requirements for value chains of the top 250 listed entities by market capitalization from the financial year 2024-2025. The introduction of ESG disclosure for value chains by SEBI is pertinent in the current context as the mandate ensures inclusion of smaller entities and intermediaries including the micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) sector in compliance with the disclosure norms. A value chain encompasses upstream and downstream activities involved in the operations of an entity and its inclusion in the ESG disclosure framework provides a holistic view of an entity’s ESG impact. While the mandate has galvanised the market into improving the transparency of ESG disclosures, thereby augmenting their investments in ESG, listed entities are likely to face challenges in effective implementation of the framework and compliance with the same.  This post assesses the positive aspects of the regulatory framework on ESG disclosures and examines potential challenges it may present. It concludes that the framework, while ambitious in its scope and capable of fostering a responsive corporate ecosystem, is faced with issues that may hinder its implementation. The post subsequently delves into suggestions intended to deftly redress some of such pressing issues and pave the way for a more robust and responsible corporate landscape. Positive Aspects The introduction of value chain disclosures offers a holistic regulatory framework for corporate governance, ensuring greater transparency and accountability of entities’ financial as well as socio-environmental impact. The incorporation of key performance indicators (KPIs) focused on the Indian markets (both present and emergent) will aid the process of meeting the global ESG reporting standards.  The inclusion of non-financial parameters in disclosures pertaining to value chains embodies the principle of “double materiality”, which refers to the amalgamation of impact materiality and financial materiality of an entity.  It is centred on the notion that an entity’s operational information should not only elucidate the financial impact of its operation on the entity’s value but should span its impact on society and the environment.  Moreover, SEBI’s inclusion of preliminary parameters under “BRSR Core”, a subset of the business responsibility and sustainability report (BRSR), is a valued addition as it eases the burden on small listed entities in respect of reporting on complex parameters laid down in the BRSR. The incorporation of BRSR core is in line with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ (MCA) Report of the Committee on Business Responsibility Reporting, which suggested the implementation of “BRSR Lite”’ with an aim to familiarise unlisted and small listed entities with the standards of sustainable reporting. BRSR Core is a pared down version of BRSR Comprehensive as it does not require detailed disclosures pertaining to ESG and comprises limited parameters. It is thus conducive to the implementation of the framework by such small entities in the initial phase.  Potential Challenges First, the transactional threshold poses a risk of excluding upstream or downstream partners characterised by low transactional values and significant environmental or social impact. For the purpose of disclosures, a value chain of a listed entity includes its top upstream and downstream partners which collectively comprise 75% of its purchases/sales by value respectively. However, such a transactional threshold may lead to the exclusion of an upstream or downstream partner which has a considerable environmental or social impact but entails relatively lower transaction value. Thus, disclosures may not be capable of reflecting any environmental or social malpractices of such partners with insubstantial transactional value. Secondly, the present ESG disclosures for value chains are based on the comply-or-explain basis, which may undermine compliance. Comply-or-explain approach refers to a regulatory regime of corporate governance which necessitates voluntary compliance with a given provision of a governance regime and requires disclosure of reasons for non-compliance, if any. The success of comply-or-explain presupposes the presence of several institutional conditionssuch as accountability and transparency of financial operations and wherewithal and incentives of shareholders to evaluate corporate behaviour, among others. However, the development of such conditions is likely to entail a protracted period of time and may present a problem in emerging market economies. Reportedly, less than 40% of the top 500 listed entities possess any framework of sustainability reporting, notwithstanding the compulsory implementation of BRSR since 2022-23. Difficulty in enforcing compliance coupled with cursory explanations furnished by entities for non-compliance are likely to render the approach inadequate. Thus, the efficacy of comply-or-explain in its current form is manifestly questionable.  Thirdly, the framework predominantly focuses on the fulfilment of limited parameters under the BRSR Core, marginalising the significance of primary BRSR disclosure. Presently, the listed entities are required to make disclosures for their value chain in accordance with the BRSR Core. SEBI’s decision to introduce the BRSR Core is in furtherance of enhancing the reliability of ESG disclosures, for which the listed entities will require reasonable assurance. However, the mandate only fortifies the BRSR Core parameters and makes them more reliable instead of the entire BRSR disclosure. Such a measure is likely to force the entities to prioritise fulfilling the BRSR Core parameters as they might perceive it to be a portrayal of their commitment to ESG compliances without necessarily addressing the broader parameters under the BRSR disclosure. Thus, the mandate with the BRSR Core is likely to breed distraction instead of enhancing the reliability of entire ESG disclosures.  Fourthly, the ineffectiveness of a “one-size-fits-all” approach has surfaced again as entities have to consider a wide array of small businesses and cater to different industry specific ESG frameworks pursuant to their inclusion in the value chain disclosures. While small businesses might be ready for compliance, their lack of technical competency and familiarity acts as an impediment to the reliable disclosure. Since the onus of comprehensive ESG disclosures is on the listed companies, it burdens them with the responsibility to ensure cooperation and participation of value chain partners in effective reporting on sustainability. Based on the  recommendations by Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures, the European Union (EU) is transitioning from a “one-size-fits-all” approach towards a tailored strategic response, enabling companies to disclose information according to the nature of their business, considering their size and complexity. The transition will aid value chain partners in collecting data and disclosing information pertinent to their businesses and will ease the cooperation between them and listed entities in the final disclosure process. Further, such a change will yield better results as observed in the KPMG New Zealand’s Survey of Sustainability Reporting, indicating improvement in the quality of sustainability information reported from 69% in 2017 to 74% in 2020.  Fifthly, data collection and processing may pose a challenge in the process of disclosure of information. Owing to a diverse set of parameters, there is a likelihood of incorporation of different modes of data collection and processing by value chain partners, resulting in challenges for the listed entities in obtaining the data for all KPIs. Due to the presence of a multitude of value chain partners being subject to the disclosure regulations, it can be arduous to monitor and obtain “third-party endorsed data” from them.  Suggestions and Conclusion  Although the execution of the framework faces potential challenges, there are certain practicable measures that can be undertaken in order to reinforce and ameliorate the implementation of the framework in its full rigour. In order to streamline the approach of comply-or-explain and to avoid “tick-the-box” compliance, increased supervision and regulatory enforcement must be adopted to track and tackle inadequate or cursory explanations for non-compliance. As of now, reports are to be filed in XBRL format, which is machine-readable. Mandating the reports to be prepared in iXBRL, which is both human and machine-readable allows entities to efficiently convey and compare reported information by utilising consistent tags, aiding better analysis of reports filed by entities. It also simplifies the process of report filing as it entails both human-readable and machine-readable formats in a single document, as opposed to separate filing of documents required by XBRL. Use of digital tools such as Nossa Data can provide a centralised database for collecting, analysing and sharing the data. It also mitigates any errors in the data processing and ensures accuracy and reliability. Its use of artificial intelligence in materiality mapping aids the analysis of a multitude of reports and comparison of performances to improve key issues for a specific business.  Whilst the strides taken by SEBI towards bolstering ESG compliance among listed entities are commendable, it is essential to acknowledge that certain issues in the current framework warrant immediate attention. The positive aspects of the regulatory framework, such as enhanced transparency and inclusion of BRSR Core so as to simplify the process of reporting for small and inexperienced entities demonstrate SEBI’s commitment to mould environmentally and socially conscious corporate entities as a stepping stone for achieving a responsible corporate sphere. Embracing a nuanced and adaptable approach that considers the diverse nature of businesses and value chain partners will ultimately contribute to the success and effectiveness of ESG disclosures, empowering entities to align with the global ESG disclosure standards. – Avani Hegde & Praneel Panchagavi Corporate Governance ESG SEBI"

            "Balancing Review and Recall: NCLAT on Correction of Procedural Errors By GuestJuly 21, 20237 Min readAdd comment   [Basil Gupta is a 4th year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) student at National Law University, Jodhpur] The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has clarified that it possesses the power to recall its judgments, asserting its inherent authority under Rule 11 of the NCLAT Rules, 2016. In a significant decision, a five-member bench of the NCLAT in Union Bank of India (Erstwhile Corporation Bank) v. Dinkar T. Venkatasubramanian reversed its earlier judgments of three-member benches that denied the tribunal’s power to review or recall its judgments. The five-member bench emphasized that while the NCLAT lacks the power to review judgments, it does possess the authority to recall them if any procedural errors were committed during their delivery. In this landmark ruling, the NCLAT reaffirmed its authority to recall judgments in cases of procedural errors. This decision clarifies the tribunal’s powers and reinforces its ability to rectify mistakes made during the delivery of judgments, ensuring procedural fairness and justice in its proceedings. Brief Facts of the Case In the present case, the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) was initiated upon an application by the Union Bank of India under section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) against Amtek Auto Ltd. (the corporate debtor). The committee of creditors (CoC), through a majority vote, approved a resolution plan submitted by a successful resolution applicant. However, the Union Bank of India, as a financial creditor, expressed its dissent towards the resolution plan and filed an interlocutory application seeking specific reliefs and modifications to the plan. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the resolution plan while rejecting the application of the Union Bank of India. Consequently, the bank appealed the decision to the NCLAT without including the CoC as a party. The NCLAT partially allowed the appeal. Dissatisfied with the order, the financial creditors led by the State Bank of India (being the appellant) challenged it through an appeal before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal but granted the liberty to file a review application before the NCLAT. The State Bank of India filed a review application with the NCLAT, which was dismissed on the grounds that the IBC does not encompass any provisions for review. Nonetheless, the NCLAT provided the liberty to seek other remedies in accordance with the law. Subsequently, the State Bank of India submitted an application to recall the order, which underwent deliberation by a three-member bench of the NCLAT. The bench referred the matter to a larger bench to determine whether the NCLAT possesses inherent jurisdiction to consider applications for the recall of judgments based on sufficient grounds. Tribunal’s Decision The NCLAT initiated its analysis by comparing rule 11 of the NCLAT Rules, 2016 with section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), and took into account certain judgments of the Supreme Court. The NCLAT noted that although courts and tribunals may differ in procedures, their fundamental functions are essentially the same. It observed that the inherent powers of a court or tribunal are not explicitly conferred but derived from the inherent duty to uphold justice for the parties involved. The NCLAT then examined the Supreme Court judgment in A.R Antulay v. R.S Nayak, which held that in cases where no notice is served on a party against whom a decree has been passed, and there is a clear violation of the principles of natural justice, the affected party has the right to approach the court that issued the decree. Furthermore, the NCLAT considered a series of Supreme Court judgments to distinguish between the powers of review and recall of a court or tribunal. The NCLAT clarified that it should not be misunderstood as an opportunity to reexamine a case or scrutinize the judgment for apparent errors, which falls under the review process. Instead, the power of recall can be used by the tribunal in cases where procedural errors occurred during the delivery of the initial judgment. These errors may include situations such as failure to serve necessary parties or the absence of a crucial party during the issuance of an unfavourable judgment. The NCLAT also acknowledged the well-established principle that a judgment can be recalled based on fraud committed to obtain it, which is a recognized reason for exercising the power of recall in legal proceedings. Based on this analysis, the NCLAT reviewed the orders in the cases of Agarwal Coal Corporation Private Limited v. Sun Paper Mill Limited, and Rajendra Mulchand Varma v. K.L.J Resources Limited. It partially overturned these judgments to the extent they held that the NCLAT lacks the power to recall its orders or judgments. However, it upheld the part of the judgments stating that the NCLAT does not possess the power of review. Analysis The NCLAT conducted an extensive analysis of the authority granted to tribunals under section 424(2) of the Companies Act, 2013. It noted that these powers closely resemble those given to civil courts under the CPC. Additionally, rule 11 of the NCLAT Rules, 2016, which deals with inherent power, is similar to section 151 of the CPC. The NCLAT also emphasized the Supreme Court’s decision in Harinagar Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Shyam Sunder Jhunjhunwala, which affirmed that while the procedures of courts and tribunals may differ, their fundamental functions remain essentially the same. It stressed that the inherent power of both courts and tribunals is not explicitly conferred but arises from their duty to provide justice to the parties involved. Furthermore, the NCLAT cited the Supreme Court’s observation in Manohar Lal Chopra v. Rai Bahadur Rao Raja Seth Hiralal stating that courts and tribunals can exercise inherent power to ensure justice between the parties, as long as it does not contradict any explicit statutory provisions. Conclusion The present judgment has definitively addressed the power of review and recall, not only for courts but also for the NCLAT and NCLT. This significant development aims to streamline the resolution of clerical and procedural errors by minimizing unnecessary appeals. However, a valid concern arises regarding potential abuse of this ruling, as litigants may attempt to exploit it by filing review applications disguised as recall applications. This exploitation could undermine the effectiveness of the IBC’s mechanisms for banks and financial institutions, allowing parties to seek the reversal of unfavourable outcomes and stall further proceedings. Only time will reveal the true extent to which the delicate balance between the power of review and recall will be maintained in spirit. Additionally, it has become common practice to invoke rule 11 when specific provisions are absent under the Companies Act or the NCLT rules. This practice highlights the need for the NCLT to more confidently exercise its inherent powers and address matters falling within its jurisdiction. Currently, the hesitancy or reluctance to invoke these inherent powers results in aggrieved parties resorting to the NCLAT and other forums, leading to substantial waste of valuable time for all parties involved. In conclusion, while the recent clarification of the NCLAT’s power of review and recall provides much-needed clarity, precautions must be taken to prevent misuse of this ruling. Moreover, the NCLT should adopt a more assertive approach in utilizing its inherent powers, reducing the burden on appellate authorities, and ensuring efficient and timely resolution of cases. – Basil Gupta Company Law Insolvency"

            "SEBI’s Sponsorship Shake-Up: Unravelling the Implications for Mutual Funds By GuestJuly 19, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [RS Sanjanaa is a third-year BA LLB (Hons.) student at Symbiosis Law School, Pune] A sponsor of a mutual fund refers to any bank, financial institution or a corporate who acts as the promoter of the mutual fund. The entity establishes the fund, obtains necessary approvals and funding, and incorporates an asset management company (“AMC”). On June 27, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) (Amendment) Regulations, 2023 (“Regulations”), which amended the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, addressing various aspects such as sponsor criteria, disassociation of sponsors, trustee responsibilities, AMC governance, and sponsor track record. This post provides an overview of the pre-existing context and summarizes the key points of the Regulations. It also evaluates the potential positive impact of these Regulations on the mutual funds industry and discusses any potential issues they may present. It concludes that these Regulations offer much-needed clarity and aim to improve corporate governance in the mutual funds sector, but unresolved issues need prompt attention. Understanding the Context Prior to the introduction of the Regulations, the eligibility criteria for mutual fund sponsors were outlined in regulation 7 of the SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996. These criteria included the requirement for sponsors to have a minimum of five years’ experience in financial services, a positive net worth over the previous five years, and a contribution of at least 40% to the fund. Proposing reforms to this framework, on January 13, 2023, SEBI released the “Consultation Paper on Review of Regulatory Framework for Sponsors of a Mutual Fund” based on the Draft Recommendations of a working group, which received endorsement from the Mutual Funds Advisory Committee. The paper highlights that over time it became apparent that once a mutual fund was well-established, the sponsor’s role diminished and became minimal, often reduced to merely signing the trust deed. This shift has been attributed to factors such as the reduction of guaranteed mutual funds, the emergence of in-house legal and financial experts within AMCs, the growth of AMCs themselves as sponsors, and the standardization of mutual fund trust deeds, reducing the need for individual contracts. Consequently, sponsors began to recede to the role of investors. Hence, recognizing the need to facilitate new entrants in the sector to attract fresh capital, foster innovation, encourage competition, and provide exit options for existing sponsors, SEBI implemented the present Regulations. A similar attempt was made through an amendment in 2021, which allowed entities with a positive net worth of at least INR 100 crore to sponsor, even without a profitability track record. Overview of the Regulations The Regulations have been released by SEBI pursuant to its powers under section 30 read with section 11(2)(c) of the SEBI Act, 1992. The main aspects of this have been listed below. Liquid Net Worth (Regulation 2) Under regulation 2, the definition of liquid net worth has been added and defined as the net worth deployed in liquid assets which are unencumbered and includes cash, money market instruments, government securities, treasury bills, repo on government securities, and other instruments as specified by SEBI later on. Original Criteria (Regulation 7(a)) Under the Regulations, the sponsor must meet three key conditions to be considered as having a “sound track record” under the amended clause. These conditions are as follows:  The entity must have recorded a net profit in each of the immediately preceding five years, as opposed to the previous requirement of three out of five years. The average net profit over these five years, after deducting depreciation, interest, and tax, should be at least INR 10 crores. The liquid net worth mentioned earlier must exceed the proposed capital contribution by the sponsor.  Alternate Criteria (Proviso to Regulation 7(a)) In cases where an entity does not meet the previously mentioned eligibility criteria, it still has the opportunity to become a sponsor, subject to certain conditions. These conditions are as follows:  The sponsor must adequately capitalize the AMC to ensure that the net worth of the AMC remains above INR 150 crores. The initial shareholding, amounting to at least INR 150 crores, must be locked in for a minimum of five years. The entity must appoint senior management personnel (as listed in the Regulations) to the AMC, with a combined experience of no less than thirty years. If an AMC is acquired, the entity must maintain liquid net worth equal to the incremental capitalization required to meet the first condition.  Disassociation of Sponsor (Regulation 7C) Existing sponsors can disassociate from the AMC provided the AMC has a diverse shareholding, with no single shareholder having more than 10% shareholding, and the board of directors has at least two-thirds independent directors. Assessing the Potential Positive Impact on Industry The primary positive impact of the Regulations is the enhancement of investor confidence through the requirement of a sound track record, leading to increased financial stability of sponsors. This mitigates the risks associated with sponsor-related issues and improves the functioning of mutual funds. A relevant example is Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, which has served as a sponsor for various funds and demonstrated consistent profitability, attracting a substantial number of investors and capital inflows. Moreover, the provision on sponsor disassociation and the inclusion of independent directors promote effective corporate governance practices. This was evident in the case of Franklin Templeton Investments, where the presence of independent directors would have facilitated independent oversight and reduced the influence of sponsors, enabling better industry risk assessment and management. Furthermore, the allowance of sponsor disassociation reduces compliance requirements when the sponsor’s shareholding falls below 10% in the AMC. This grants the AMC greater independence and flexibility in its operations, while still ensuring regulatory compliance. Additionally, the implementation of a lock-in threshold of INR 150 crores, instead of the previous 40% shareholding threshold, offers improved exit options for sponsors, particularly in high net worth AMCs. This requirement ensures adequate capitalization of the AMC and adherence to regulatory standards. Impediments Arising from the New Regulations While the intended impact of the Regulations on the industry is commendable, certain issues arise that need attention. First, the heightened capital requirements create financial barriers for small sponsors. Consequently, market concentration would inadvertently favour larger sponsors, leading to reduced diversity. An analogous situation can be seen in the European Union’s Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which proposed similarly stringent capital requirements for investment managers, such as a minimum initial capital criterion of €300,000. As a result, small investment managers could face challenges in launching their businesses, establishing new funds, and attracting investors. Moreover, this could potentially drive small entities to merge with or be acquired by larger ones, impacting competition. Secondly, the previous provision allowing early-stage entities to sponsor a mutual fund, provided they had a net worth of at least INR 100 crores in the absence of meeting the ‘three out of five years’ profit requirement, has been removed. This means that they would now be subject to alternative criteria. SEBI’s aim in doing so is to prioritize financial viability and enhance risk management. However, this change will discourage loss-making early-stage entities from participating in sponsoring mutual funds. Ultimately, it will hinder innovation and competition in the sector, impeding access to capital for these entrepreneurial entities. Thirdly, the Regulations present implementation challenges. For instance, there is a lack of clarity on the status of pending applications with SEBI. Furthermore, they impose an additional disclosure burden and compliance hurdles, such as evaluating the current liquid net worth of all sponsors. Furthermore, the Regulations could temporarily disrupt the market as all AMCs will need to restructure their operations, adjust business strategies, and ensure compliance, leading to a period of market volatility. Fourthly, the liquid net worth requirement has a detrimental impact, extending to the individual sponsor level. Sponsors will need to reallocate a significant portion of their assets to liquid investments, which limits investment flexibility and reduces their risk-taking capacity. Moreover, this increases compliance costs for sponsors, as liquid assets tend to yield lower returns compared to other options like stocks or bonds. Ultimately, this affects the profitability of sponsors, which is, in fact, an eligibility criterion for sponsorship. Fifthly, the increased representation of independent directors may strain the sponsor-AMC relationship. It could potentially lead to heightened conflicts and a reduction in the alignment of interests between the two parties, as sponsors would have less influence on strategic decisions. Conclusion Despite the notable challenges and issues associated with the Regulations, their importance cannot be undermined. While there is a need for SEBI to carefully evaluate and address the potential negative impacts, such as by introducing proportionate requirements based on sponsor characteristics instead of a generic capital cap, the overall objective of the Regulations remains crucial. They are designed to safeguard investor interests, foster market stability, enhance corporate governance practices, and uphold the reputation of the mutual funds industry. It is imperative for stakeholders to work collaboratively towards refining and implementing these regulations to ensure their effectiveness and long-term success. – RS Sanjanaa Financial Markets Mutual Funds Regulation SEBI"

            "Identifying Senior Managers: Revisions to Listing Rules By GuestJuly 19, 202311 Min readAdd comment   [Pammy Jaiswal and Mahak Agarwal are with Vinod Kothari & Co] The concepts of senior management (‘SM’) and senior managerial person or personnel (‘SMP’ or ‘SMPs’) was not present under the regime established by the Companies Act, 1956, and it was first introduced in section 178 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act, 2013’). The law requires the nomination and remuneration committee to establish the compensation policies of SMPs. The definition under the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (the ‘LODR’) issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’) has, over time, been aligned with that under the Act, 2013. These definitions have been around for almost 10 years now, and therefore, largely seem to have settled. However, the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2023 (issued on 14 June 2023) (the ‘LODR Amendments’) have introduced several new information requirements and obligations pertaining to SMPs. This has given rise to a need to relook at the said position from a fresh perspective. Given the fact that the amendments specify newer and stricter obligations and disclosure norms for SMPs, it becomes imperative for companies to revisit the following matters:  Determining who are currently designated as SMPs; and Identifying, with a new perspective, the persons who shall explicitly fall under this definition;  and accordingly, attract the applicability of various requirements as discussed hereinbelow. Our detailed FAQs on the LODR Amendments can be viewed here. The Concept of Senior Management under the Act, 2013 The scope of law revolving around ‘senior management’ under the Act, 2013 is limited. It discusses the meaning of, and the manner of appointment and removal of, SMPs. Meaning The term ‘senior management’ under the Act, 2013 means personnel of the company who are members of its core management team, excluding board of directors, comprising all members of management one level below the executive directors, including the functional heads. Appointment, Removal and Remuneration of SMPs Section 178 of the Act, 2013 requires the nomination and remuneration committee to be responsible for identifying persons who may be appointed in senior management and are also required to recommend to the board their appointment or removal. Further, the law also provides emphasis on formulation of requisite criteria for ensuring balance between fixed and incentive pay with respect to the remuneration payable to SMPs. Definition and Meaning of SMPs  Regulation 16 of the LODR defines senior management as under: “Senior  management”  shall  mean  the  officers  and  personnel  of  the  listed  entity  who  are  members  of  its  core  management  team,  excluding the Board  of  Directors,  and  shall also comprise all the members of  the  management  one  level  below  the  Chief    Executive    Officer  or  Managing    Director  or  Whole    Time  Director or Manager (including  Chief  Executive  Officer and Manager,  in  case  they  are  not  part  of  the Board of Directors)  and  shall  specifically  include the functional heads, by whatever name called and the Company  Secretary  and the Chief  Financial Officer” Accordingly, following are the inclusions and exclusions in the definition: Inclusions   Members of core management team; All members of the management one level  below the chief executive officer (‘CEO’), managing director (‘MD’), or wholetime director (‘WTD’); CEO, manager (in case not part of the board of directors); Specifically include functional heads; and Company secretary and chief financial officer (‘CFO’).  Exclusions  Board of Directors   On a reading of the aforesaid definition of SMP, it is understood that the same is an inclusive definition and, therefore, the actual identification of SM in a company will depend on  several factors, like the meaning and participants of core management group, members falling under one level below the board, and the organizational hierarchy. For defining the officers falling under ‘core management group’ one may consider the members of the promoter group taking part in the crucial management discussions, in case there is a formal committee/ group to that effect. As regards the members falling under ‘one level below the board’ is concerned, the ones who report to the MD/ CEO or officers responsible for general management of the company would be regarded as an inclusion in the said category. Understanding ‘Core Management’ and ‘Functional Heads’ Generally speaking, core management would mean members of the management responsible for core business functions of the organization. Core Management To further understand who shall fall under the ambit of core management, reference may be taken from Singapore Guidelines on Individual Accountability and Conduct applicable to Financial Institutions (regulated by Monetary Authority of Singapore), which provides a list of persons to be included in ‘core management functions’. The list includes CEO, CFO, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Operating Officer/Head of Operations, Chief Information Officer/Chief Technology Officer/Head of Information Technology, Chief Information Security Officer/Head of Information Security, Chief Data Officer, Chief Regulatory Officer, heads of business functions, head of actuarial/appointed actuary/certifying actuary, Head of Human Resources, Head of Compliance, Head of Financial Crime Prevention, and Head of Internal Audit. Similarly, the Ministry of Economic, Trade and Industry, Japan in its Revised CGS Guidelines has laid emphasis on the composition and delegation of powers to ‘top management’. It provides an indication on the nature of work done and the members falling under the said category which includes president, CFO, CXO, etc. Functional Head Business functions are the activities carried out by an enterprise: they can be divided into core functions and support functions. Core business functions would mean those functions which yield income for an enterprise and these functions generally make up the primary activities of the enterprise. These would normally include operations, marketing, finance, and compliance and could otherwise vary based on the nature of the enterprise. Support business functions are ancillary (supporting) activities carried out by the enterprise to permit or to facilitate the core business functions, its production activity. These activities may include distribution and  logistics, IT services, technical services, etc. However, in the context of defining SMPs, what shall be relevant are the heads of the core functional departments of the company who report directly to the MD or WTD and the ancillary or supporting heads shall be disregarded while interpreting the definition of SM. On a joint reading of the aforesaid discussion on core management as well as functional head, it becomes clear that senior persons from ancillary or support services may form part of the core management; however, the same need not be categorized under functional head for the purpose of these regulations. Example to Understand Core Management Team and Functional Heads For a large-scale organization, the identification becomes even more crucial since a liberal interpretation of the meaning would involve a number of employees under the said definition and, thus, lead to several implications as discussed below. To understand the same, consider an example of K Ltd, which has several plant locations around the country with plant heads controlling the functions at each plant. All the plant heads report to the head of operations as well as the CFO. Further, the said company has around 15 functional departments, out of which 12 are main line functions and the rest are ancillary to one of the main functions. Every main line function has a functional head, and the ancillary functions have controllers reporting to the one of the functional head of the main line function. The heads of the main line functions report to the MD of K Ltd. In the given case, if we take a close look at the definition of SM, then the following should be the result of the identification of SMs in K Ltd:  Plant heads – Not an SM since they report to head of operations, therefore, not falling under one level below the board. Heads of main line functions – Should be categorised as an SM since they fall under one level below the board Controllers of ancillary functions – Not an SM since they report to head of main line functions.  Understanding the Implications  On SM Personnel The amended regulations along with the existing regulations applicable to SMs impose the following obligations on them: 1. SMs are required to act with operational transparency while also maintaining confidentiality of information [regulation 4(2)(f)]; 2. They are required to disclose to the board all material, commercial and financial transactions in which they have personal interest and which may lead to potential conflict of interest with the listed entity at large [regulation 26(5)]. Here, conflict of interest relates to:  Dealing in shares of listed entity; Commercial dealings with bodies, which have shareholding of management and their relatives;  3. SPs shall also be required to affirm compliance with code of conduct of senior management on an annual basis [regulation 26(3)]; On Listed Companies  Fraud by SM [Clause 6 of Para A of Part A of Sch III]  The definition and implications of being identified as an SM under the amended regulations is very wide and it is, therefore, likely that the companies may not consider covering several persons under its ambit. Fraud with respect to SM has been inclusively defined to also mean fraud under regulation 2(1)(c) of Securities and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 which itself has a very wide scope. The same covers wide range of activities including misrepresentation of truth, concealment of material facts, a suggestion as to an untrue fact, active concealment of fact in knowledge of the person making such representation, promise made without intention of performing it, reckless/careless representation, any act or omission which law declares as fraudulent, deceptive behavior, false statement, misinformation about securities that affects market price of such securities. Having said that, companies which take a liberal interpretation of the definition of SM and, accordingly, keep a long list of such persons, might have to keep constant track of such activities being undertaken by their SM which, goes without stating, is a cumbersome task. Furthermore, such cases of fraud have been classified as deemed material event under regulation 30 read with Para A Part A of Schedule III, which will have to be reported by the company to the stock exchange within 12 or 24 hours, as the case may be.  Default by SM [Clause 6 of Para A of Part A of Sch III]  The meaning of ‘default’ with regard to SM shall be seen in the following light:  non-payment of the interest or principal amount in full on the date when the debt has become due and payable; and such default which has impact on the listed entity.  Further, such defaults by SM, pursuant to the recent amendments, shall be considered a deemed material event and accordingly required to be disclosed to the stock exchange within 12 hours of such default coming into notice.  Change in SM [Clause 7 of Para A of Part A of Sch III]  Pursuant to recent amendments, change in SM shall now be a deemed material event under regulation 30 read with Para A Part A of Schedule III. In addition, the particulars of SM along with changes therein since the close of the previous financial year shall also be required to be disclosed by the company in its corporate governance report.  Resignation of SM [Clause 7C of Para A of Part A of Sch III]  The amended LODR requires companies to disclose to the stock exchange the letter of resignation as given by the concerned SM along with detailed reasons for such resignation within seven days from the date such resignation comes into effect. Such resignation letters carry a grave potential for the outgoing SM to negatively portray the image of the company. Accordingly, identification of SM personnel becomes of immense relevance.  Announcement/Communication through Social Media Intermediaries or Mainstream Media by SM [Clause 18 of Para A of Part A of Sch III]  It is stated by the recent amendments that if the SMPs of the listed entity make any announcement or communication through  social  media  intermediaries  or mainstream  media and such information is material in terms of regulation 30 and is not already made available in the public domain by the listed entity, the same shall be deemed to be a material event under Para A Part A of Schedule III and consequently required to be disclosed to the stock exchange. Conclusion In essence, the existing LODR deals with several provisions revolving around SM, imposing several disclosure norms on the company and on the SM as well. Considering these disclosures include some very sensitive areas, an immediate step for companies now will be to take a close re-look and identify the personnel that fall in this comprehensive definition in such a manner that enhanced compliances in relation to such personnel, as brought about by the recent amendments are being adequately adhered to without any adverse implications on the listed entity. – Pammy Jaiswal & Mahak Agarwal Company Law SEBI"

            "Revival of Time-Barred Debts By GuestJuly 19, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Mihir Modi is an Associate with PSL Advocates and Solicitors in Mumbai] According to the Limitation Act 1963 (‘the Limitation Act’), there is a set time limit for filing appeals and instituting lawsuits in various courts. The Limitation Act is based on the idea that there must be a strict time limit for bringing appropriate actions in the courts. In doing so, it protects only the diligent litigants, not those careless about their rights. The court does not show indulgence if a creditor seeks redress from the court after the stipulated statutory period of limitation has passed. Debt is covered by the Limitation Act, and after the prescribed limitation period has passed, the debt becomes time-barred. However, there are several situations where time-barred debt shall still remain active. Time-barred debts become active upon a promise to pay them, if certain conditions are met. This article discusses those conditions and the effect of acknowledgment of time-barred debts. What is a Time-Barred Debt? Debt is defined under section 3(11) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 as, “a liability or obligation in respect of a claim which is due from any person and includes a financial debt and operational debt.” Thus, debt is a liability or an obligation that a person owes to another person and which is claimed by that person. This includes both financial debt as well as operational debt. Time-barred debt means a debt for which the time period prescribed in the applicable statute of limitations has expired. Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963 As per plethora of decisions passed by courts and tribunals, any application for initiating insolvency against a debtor is time-barred as per article 137 of the Limitation Act, where the default has occurred more than three years prior to the filing of such proceedings. But in the cases where the debtor makes an acknowledgement of their liability towards the creditor, during the limitation period, it gives rise to a fresh limitation period to the creditor from the date of such acknowledgement. This is encompassed under Section 18 of the Limitation Act. Section 25(3) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 In the cases where there is no acknowledgement of debt by the debtor within the prescribed period and the debt becomes time-barred, such debt cannot be claimed by the creditor. However, it is equally open to the debtor to renounce or waive the right conferred on them by the law of limitation, and bind or obligate themselves afresh to discharge the debt incurred, irrespective of the fact that the debts had become barred by limitation on the date when a fresh undertaking is given to the creditor to pay off the debt. section 25 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (‘the Contract Act’), titled ‘Agreement without consideration, void, unless it is in writing and registered, or is a promise to compensate for something done or is a promise to pay a debt barred by limitation law’, provides under sub-section (3), that an agreement made without consideration is void, unless “it is a promise, made in writing and signed by the person to be charged therewith, or by his agent generally or specially authorized in that behalf, to pay wholly or in part a debt of which the creditor might have enforced payment but for the law for the limitation of suits. In any of these cases, such an agreement is a contract.” It is pertinent to note that the illustration (e) to the corresponding section is as follows: “(e) A owes B Rs. 1,000, but the debt is barred by the Limitation Act. A signs a written promise to pay B Rs. 500 on account of the debt. This is a contract.” The legislative intent behind adding exception to section 25 has been discussed by S. Swaminathan in the article titled ‘Eclipsed by Orthodoxy: The Vanishing Point of Consideration and the Forgotten Ingenuity of the Indian Contract Act, 1872’ (Asian Journal of Comparative Law, 12 (2017), pp. 141–165). A bare perusal of Section 25 of the Contract Act shows that each of the sub-sections refer to an agreement which constitutes a contract and thus, a creditor can enforce such a contract against the debtor for claiming the amounts agreed to be paid by the debtor under the contract. The conditions, which are necessary to constitute a promise under section 25(3), have been laid down in Kasturchand Jiwaji v. Manekchand Devchand, which read that “the conditions necessary to make it a promise within section 25(3) of the Contract Act are that it should be made in writing; be signed by the persons to be charged therewith; and be a promise to pay wholly or in part a debt, of which the creditor might have enforced payment but for the law for the limitation of suits. He does not say that the writing itself must purport to pay such a debt, if in fact the writing was passed for the payment of such debt.” The enforceability of the contractual obligation under this provision has also been a subject matter of several judgements. To avoid prolixity, one may refer to Kishen Lal v. Gohi (AIR 1938 Lah 757), where it was held that when a promise falls under section 25(3) of the Contract Act, it constitutes a valid agreement for the purpose of enforcing the right accruing under it, whether or not the debts covered are within limitation.    It is, no doubt, true that the Limitation Act provides a certain period during which alone a creditor is entitled to institute action against the debtor for recovery of the debt, and if the creditor fails to institute the action within the time allowed to the creditor by law, the debtor gets a vested right and is afforded opportunity to resist the action of the creditor on the ground that the claim is barred by limitation. Though a debt might have become time-barred on the date when a debtor entered into a fresh obligation with the creditor to pay the liability, the said obligation, if it satisfies the conditions laid down in section 25(3) of the Contract Act, will amount to a fresh contract in the eye of law, and can certainly be made the basis of an action for recovering the amount promised and acknowledged therein by the debtor. While section 18 of the Limitation Act deals with an acknowledgment, made by a debtor within the period of Limitation, the contractual obligation which a debtor enters into under the terms of section 25(3) of the Contract Act has no reference whatsoever to the acknowledged debt being within time or not. In that sense, the provision contained in section 25(3) is far wider in scope than the acknowledgment contemplated in section 18 of the Limitation Act. The contract entered into under section 25(3) of the Contract Act is an independent and enforceable contract and has no reference to the debt acknowledged under the contract being a live one, in the sense that it had not become barred under the law of limitation. Applicability of Section 25(3) of the Contract Act Recently, the interplay between section 25(3) of the Contract Act and section 18(1) of the Limitation Act came up for consideration before the Supreme Court in the case of Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited v. Kew Precision Parts Private Limited, wherein the Court laid down the conditions which must be satisfied to invoke section 25(3) of the Contract Act. The conditions laid down were as follows: first, it must refer to a debt, which the creditor, but for the period of limitation, might have enforced; second, there must be a distinct promise to pay such debt, fully or in part; finally, the promise must be in writing, and signed by the debtor or his duly appointed agent. The Court further observed that under section 25(3) of the Contract Act, a debtor can enter into an agreement in writing, to pay the whole or part of a debt, which the creditor might have enforced, but for the limitation of a suit in law. A written promise to pay the barred debt is a valid contract. Such a promise constitutes novation and can form the basis of a suit independent of the original debt, “for it is well settled that the debt is not extinguished, the remedy gets barred by passage of time” as held by the Supreme Court in Bombay Dyeing & Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. State of Bombay. Relying on Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited v. Kew Precision Parts Private Limited (supra), in Manju Aggarwal v. Prayag Polytech Private Limited Delhi High Court held that a written promise to pay a time barred debt is a valid contract in law and such a promise can form an independent basis for a suit. It was further observed that the settlement agreement between the parties in that case qualified as an agreement under Section 25(3) of the Contract Act inasmuch as it was a clear and unconditional promise on behalf of the defendants to pay a certain sum of money to the plaintiff. On the face of it, the agreement was signed by all the defendants wherein they had admitted their liability to pay the loan amount to the plaintiff. Conclusion Section 25(3) of the Contract Act applies only where the debt is one which would be enforceable against the debtor, but for the law of limitation. Where a debt is not binding on the debtor for other reasons, and consequentially not enforceable against the debtor, there is no question of applicability of Section 25(3). There exists a distinction between acknowledgment under Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963, and a promise within the meaning of Section 25 of the Contract Act. Both, the acknowledgment and the promise, respectively, in writing and signed by a party or their authorised agents, have the effect of resetting the clock of limitation. In the case of Sri Kapaleswarar Temple v. T. Tirunavukarasu is was observed that there is, however, a distinction between the nature of acknowledgement by a debtor under the respective provisions, inasmuch as, while both have the effect of giving a fresh lease of life to the enforceability of debt, an acknowledgement under Section 18 of the Limitation Act must be made on or before the date of expiry of the limitation period, whereas by its very nature a promise under Section 25(3) of the Contract Act will only be made after expiry of limitation period. In other words, a promise under Section 25(3) of the ICA made after the limitation period expires, would give a cause of action to the creditor to enforce the claim, notwithstanding the initial period of limitation, and the debt cannot be said to be barred. – Mihir Modi Contract Law Limitation"

            "Corporate Climate Litigation: Comparing ClientEarth-Shell with the Indian Regulatory Framework By GuestJuly 18, 202311 Min readAdd comment   [Dhanshitha Ravi and Santosh S are third and final year law students respectively at Symbiosis Law School, Pune] The United Kingdom High Court (“UKHC”) on the 12 May 2023 delivered a landmark judgment in the realm of corporate jurisprudence in a first of its kind climate-change based derivative action in ClientEarth v. Shell plc. This action was brought by ClientEarth, a minority shareholder in Shell plc, on behalf of the company, against the directors, to hold them accountable for breach of their fiduciary duties for not putting in place an adequate risk policy to combat climate change. Given Shell is one of the biggest carbon emitters, contributing 1.8% of the annual global emissions, the absence of such a policy was potentially detrimental to the long-term interests of the company. The UKHC, however, dismissed the derivative action, which could potentially be a setback to corporate climate litigation across the globe, including in developing countries like India wherein such litigation is considerably nascent and rare. Unlike in instances such as the Sterlite case in Tamil Nadu, where environment-specific regulations have been invoked against corporations, India is yet to witness litigation in the form of a derivative action representing climate-related interests. This post seeks to explain the Indian approach regarding directors’ duties in the context of the environment and how the thresholds established in ClientEarth do not squarely comply with the Indian approach. Indian Position on Directors’ Duties Towards the Environment Prior to the Companies Act, 2013, the Indian regime adopted a restrictive approach that cast an onus on the directors to discharge their duties to solely enhance the value of shareholders. With the 2013 Act, that model was replaced by a stakeholder model or a “pluralist approach” which envisages the duties of directors under section 166, drawing inspiration from section 172 of the UK Companies Act 2006. Directors are required to act in “the best interests” of the company as well as the community and towards the protection of the environment. Furthermore, it also casts an onus on the directors to perform duties with reasonable care, skill and diligence. The language employed herein casts a positive obligation on the directors through an equitable approach which treats all stakeholders with parity. As opposed to the enlightened shareholder value (“ESV”) model prevalent in the UK, Indian law requires directors to unequivocally consider all stakeholders’ interests. Pioneering this approach, in M.K. Ranjitsinh v. Union of India, the Supreme Court suggested that installation of overhead power lines in areas critical to the habitat of the Great Indian Bustard would potentially vitiate the contours of directors’ duties towards the environment under company law. Further, the Court observed that the high cost of adopting climate sensitive methods would not shield the directors from doing so, thereby reaffirming the positive obligations cast on the directors regarding climate. Beyond the director duties under company law, the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR”) prescribe certain disclosure requirements as well as directors’ duties towards stakeholders that directly or indirectly require listed entities to have climate-sensitive policies in place. These include regulations 4(2)(f)(ii) and 17(9)(b), which require risk management measures on part of the board, keeping long-term interests of the company in picture. Regulation 21(4) also requires certain listed entities to formulate a risk management committee. These regulations must be conjointly read with the requirement under regulation 34(2)(f) to furnish an annual report consisting of a business responsibility section that is supposed to contain the environment, social and governance (“ESG”) perspectives of certain listed entities. Given the specific emphasis on ESG and long-term interests of the company, a purposive interpretation of the LODR must imply the inclusion of climate-related risks within the meaning of “risk management”.   If a breach of such duties occurs, shareholders, in the absence of alternative remedies, are forced to bring a representative claim on behalf of the company against the directors in the form of a derivative action. Such an action is an exception to the proper plaintiff rule established in Foss v. Harbottle (1843) 2 Hare 461, which necessitates that only a company may sue wrongdoers for the loss that it suffers. Being a representative suit, a derivative action allows shareholders to sue on behalf of the company when a breach of fiduciary duties occurs. In India, a representative suit can be brought under Order I, Rule 8 of the Civil Procedure Code and has strict requirements for a court to grant leave to the plaintiff, being, inter alia, satisfaction of the clean-hands doctrine, which requires a plaintiff shareholder to not have vested interests in the outcome of such an action. It is pertinent to note that Indian courts have treated the proper plaintiff rule as sacrosanct and, therefore, significantly curtailed the use of DAs. Unduly Restrictive Thresholds Laid Down in ClientEarth  The UKHC in ClientEarth primarily makes two important observations relevant to this discussion (a detailed commentary of the judgement can be accessed here). First, by implicitly applying what is arguably a far-fetched interpretation of the business judgement rule, the UKHC refrained from assessing the decisions made by the directors while discharging their duties. It laid special emphasis on the fact that judicial bodies must exercise restraint and allow derivative actions for alleged breach of duties only in “limited and restricted circumstances”. The Court also suggested that such issues can be voiced and voted upon by members in an annual general meeting, following the rationale of the well-established majority rule in Foss.  Second, the threshold to satisfy the “good faith” requirement to admit a derivative action has been significantly heightened. Akin to the clean-hands doctrine in India, usually a court weighs the motives of the plaintiff and discourages litigation based on ulterior motives. In this case, one primary reason to dismiss the action appears to be the supposed failure of ClientEarth to adduce sufficient evidence to refute ulterior motives, merely because they were minority shareholders in the company. That reasoning only reasserts the rule in Foss, but does not view the countless instances where derivative action has been viewed as an exception to the said rule. The manner in which the UKHC has applied both business judgment rule and the good faith requirement is narrow and can have a cascading effect by eliminating shareholder activism, especially in the form of climate-related litigation. Comparing ClientEarth Standards vis-à-vis the Indian Approach The UKHC’s strong presumption in favor of board decisions is not necessarily akin to Indian law. The Bombay High Court in Re Cadbury India Ltd. ruled that greater significance has to be given to protecting the rights and concerns of minority shareholders, thereby shifting the onus on the board to demonstrate that their actions were beneficial for the company and its stakeholders. More often than not, in climate-related questions, the business judgment rule viewed from the ESV perspective can lead to diametrically opposite conclusions, i.e., what may be in the interests of shareholder value for a climate-sensitive business may be entirely harmful to the environment. Per contra, the pluralist approach in Indian law would give no room to such possibilities because board decisions would have to be weighed from the perspective of different stakeholders, without ipso facto prioritizing one interest over the other. Therefore, boards cannot use the business judgment rule as an immunity doctrine in India and refuse to address climate-related risks. Additionally, requirements under the LODR make it explicitly clear that the board of a listed entity has to make environment-based disclosures on an annual basis, alongside satisfying the duty towards stakeholders in terms of active risk management bearing in mind long-term interests of the company. Failure to comply with the LODR is arguably outside the contours of the defence of the business judgment rule. In so far as the “good faith” requirement is concerned, a well-established exception to Foss v. Harbottle states that when “wrongdoers are in control” of the company, a derivative action may lie at the behest of the minority in order to remedy the “corporate” wrongdoing [laid down in Wallersteiner v Moir (No 2) [1975] QB 373 and Waddington Ltd v Chan Chun Hoo Thomas].  In most circumstances where minority shareholders seek to remedy an alleged breach of fiduciary duties on behalf of the company, the directors are in control of the company, making it virtually impossible for a company to bring a claim against such alleged wrongdoing. This necessitates an exception to allow derivative actions when wrongdoers are in control of the company. Therefore, the observation of the UKHC on the “good faith” requirement, albeit obiter dicta, ignores this pertinent exception to Foss. Further, the rarity of derivative actions in India, alongside the usage of clean-hands doctrine on a case-by-case basis evidences the extant safeguards to prevent an abuse of such a remedy. But the restrictive approach taken in ClientEarth by merely invoking plaintiff’s status as a minority shareholder renders obsolete the very purpose of resorting to derivative action as a remedy. Reassessing ClientEarth: the Way Forward from an Indian Perspective In rejecting ClientEarth’s derivative action, the UKHC ruled that a board of directors has no “absolute” duty towards the environment. While that stance is contestable within UK law in itself, it is clear that within Indian law stakeholders do not have a hierarchical order in priority. More importantly, it is within a company’s best interest to manage climate risk since an omission on this front can be detrimental to its own long-term interests. For instance, in Re Caremark International Inc. Derivative Litigation, a different approach was sought and the Delaware Court of Chancery placed a higher onus on the board by requiring directors to show particular care and diligence on mission-critical issues. To justify a Caremark claim, the plaintiff has the option to prove one of the two prongs i.e., either no system of control or risk management existed to begin with or that such a system of control or risk policy did not have sufficient oversight mechanism, which eventually nullifies the purpose of risk control. The application of such an approach would require climate-sensitive businesses to exercise reasonable skill and diligence to manage climate risks, in particular. This Caremark approach is also reflected in the LODR requirements under regulation 34 that mandate the top 1,000 listed companies by market capital to produce an ESG report on an annual basis. Such companies are more likely to contribute to emissions and have a greater impact on climate-related concerns, making it “mission-critical” for them to be environmentally conscious. Furthermore, the essence of the two-pronged approach to survive a Caremark claim has also been embedded in regulation 17 which specifically casts an onus on the board to frame, implement and monitor a risk management plan. In our view, the absence of a climate-risk policy, especially with companies that are climate-sensitive (by size or nature of business), would amount to a square violation of the directors’ duties under Indian law. Further, going by the Dutch Court’s understanding in Milieudefensie et al. v. Royal Dutch Shell plc, merely acknowledging climate as a risk is untenable and directors ought to take affirmative steps to effectively control climate risk as part of an “unwritten standard of care”. Conclusion An analysis of both company and securities regulation in India clearly establishes a forward-looking approach on directors’ duties towards alleviating climate risk. While admitting derivative actions, especially at the behest of minority shareholders, does possess the threat of opening up floodgates, the safeguards, both in civil procedure and substantive law in the form of Foss, coupled with the sheer costs involved in such a litigation, are enough mitigating factors to limit the scope of such derivative actions. Furthermore, the increasing set of ESG requirements has restricted the scope of business judgment rule. The duty of loyalty, skill and diligence requires directors to comply with codified ESG requirements. Failing to do so, either by violating legal obligations or neglecting their responsibilities in overseeing the company’s activities, renders board members ineligible for the protections provided by the business judgment rule. In such a regulatory landscape, forewarned is forearmed. – Dhanshitha Ravi & Santosh S Climate Change Companies Act Company Law International Developments Minority Shareholders SEBI"

            "Balancing Contractual Autonomy vis-à-vis Application of Section 74 of the Contract Act, 1872: Part II By GuestJuly 18, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Lavanya Pathak and Pallavi Mishra are advocates practicing at the Delhi High Court. This is a continuation from Part I] Position Taken by High Courts at Bombay, Delhi and Madras The recent judgements rendered by High Courts at Bombay, Delhi and Madras (discussed below) are instructive when it comes to offering clarity on the SC’s understanding of the law on liquidated damages and penalties. In Ultratech Cement Ltd. v. Sunfield Resources Pty. Ltd., the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court repelled the appellant’s argument that the stipulated sum was in terrorem. The Court carefully examined the scheme of the provisions in light of the precedent laid down in Mahadeoprasad v. Siemens (India) Limited to hold that for the purposes of §74, damages must be proved in a “general sense” as the “…contract made between the parties estimating their damages is in itself evidence of damages”. The Division Bench further placed reliance on the judgement in K.P. Subbarama Sastri v. K.S. Raghavan, where the SC had held that the determination as to whether a particular contractual clause containing pre-determined calculation of damages is in the nature of penalty must be assessed against the background of various factors such as the character of the transaction, relative position and intention of the parties. Justice Kulkarni relying upon the SC judgements in Fateh Chand, Saw Pipes, and Kailash Nath enunciated that in the context of liquidated damages as agreed between the parties, upon breach of the contract, the suffering party would be entitled to receive compensation for any loss arising within the usual course, without having a necessity to lead evidence for proving damages. The Division Bench specifically opined that when an agreement is executed “…by the experts in the field and when an agreement is so arrived in their commercial wisdom, it cannot be construed that the intention of the parties was different from what they have agreed in having such a stipulation in the contract”. The burden in such a case would be on the party who contends that the stipulated amount in the agreement is unreasonable, to prove the same. It is clear that the Division Bench considered the precedents laid down in Saw Pipes and Kailash Nath to be in consonance with each-other, and further noted that the very purpose of agreeing to a genuine pre-estimate of damages was to avoid litigation and foster certainty; hence, unless specifically pleaded to be in the nature of penalty, the breaching party cannot evade its liability to pay damages that it had itself agreed to pay during the execution of the contract. In Dhiraj Lakhamashi Shah v. Madhav Hari Karmakar, the Bombay High Court, yet again, considered the impact of a clause stipulating genuine pre-estimate of damages in a contract in context of §74 and reiterated the supremacy of party autonomy to the effect that “…the contract made by the parties estimating their damages, is in itself, an evidence on the quantum of such damages”. Justice Kulkarni further opined that a contractual clause agreed between parties would have a binding effect and can only be displaced if specifically challenged and established on “glaring materials”; “pleas lacking a foundation” cannot deprive the suffering party of its right to get the stipulated sum which was contemplated and negotiated at the time of execution of the contract. The Court further observed that when the term of the agreement envisages the award of damages, it is “unfair and unpalatable” for the breaching party to seek to override such an agreement by resorting to §§73 and 74 of the Contract Act. Similarly, in Gail (India) Limited v. Punj Lloyd Limited, the Division Bench of the Delhi High held that clauses stipulating genuine pre-estimate of damages are “…not merely precautionary conditions not meant to be enforced, but conditions that could be insisted upon” without proof of actual loss.  In M/s Phoenix Yule Ltd. v. Neyveli Lignite Corporation Limited, the Madras High Court while applying Saw Pipescategorically held that the assessment of reasonableness of damages as discussed in §§73 and 74 will come into play only when the terms of the contract are ambiguous and the estimate provided in the contract is proved to be unreasonable as per the principles laid down in Saw Pipes. Analysis While the previous sections of the post examined the scheme of provisions and precedents, in what follows, this part delves into analysing the divergent views with respect to a court’s jurisdiction in determining the award of damages when the contract already contains a pre-determined estimate as agreed between the parties. One line of thought rests on the argument that the courts should ideally not displace the commercial wisdom and party autonomy that form the basis of contractual agreements, and thus award the damages as contemplated thereunder. The alternate argument emanates from the fundamentals of compensatory damages and principles of equity cautioning against unjust enrichment, and unconscionable bargain.   In the context  of the above precedents, it is the authors’ view that the High Courts have sought to apply the law laid down in Saw Pipes and Kailash Nath, albeit stressing on different aspects of these decisions, with  different courts  placing  reliance on different shades of the precedents. However, all in all, the question that remains to be considered is whether §74 should play a part in displacing an agreement between parties stipulating payment of a sum on breach, especially when the breaching party has not placed on record any materials to dispute that the clause does not represent a genuine pre-estimate of damages. Considering the inclusion of the liquidated damages-penalty dichotomy in Indian law by the courts, it undeniably flows from a reading of §74 that even though a contract falls within the private realm of two parties, the court is not powerless to grant relief against clauses in the nature of a penalty. The use of the word ‘reasonable compensation’ predicates the jurisdiction of the court to adjust the ‘sum named in the contract’ to be awarded to ensure that the clause is not enforced in terrorem. However, §74 does not lay down a straight-jacket formula to determine whether a clause stipulating pre-estimated damages constitutes an imposition of penalty or not, and is required to be tested in context of agreement between the parties, as laid down by the precedents discussed above. In the authors’ view, the approach taken by the courts should hinge on preserving the sanctity of the contract by making a presumption in favour of enforcement of a contractual clause as inserted by the parties based on their commercial wisdom. To this extent, it is a mixed question of law and fact as to whether a clause constitutes penalty or not. However, the courts should set a rigorous standard of proof upon the breaching party claiming the clause to be in the nature of penalty or disputing the quantum of damages to be paid. Further, it is suggested that in cases where there is evidence of the fact that the inclusion of a clause stipulating pre-determined damages was a product of negotiation between the parties on a level playing field, the court should refrain from invoking its jurisdiction to vary the quantum to be awarded. At this juncture, it is necessary to consider the relatively recent decision of the UK Supreme Court in the case of Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi (“Cavendish”) and ParkingEye Limited v. Beavis where the liquidated damages-penalty dichotomy has been blurred by stating that the law should respect the contractual bargain between the parties and not necessarily fall into the semantics of categorising a clause as penalty, which had in fact been agreed to between the parties in their commercial wisdom. The Court also reiterated that “…the starting point at common law is that parties should be kept to their bargains, and it is for those objecting that a clause is penal to establish its exorbitant nature” [Shivprasad Swaminathan, ‘A Centennial Refurbishment of Dunlop’s Contractual Concepts’ (2016) 45 Common Law World Review 248-256]. While the question as to whether or not the amount fixed in the contract is a genuine pre-estimate of damages or a penalty will have to be determined according to the facts of each case, the judicial practice should proceed on the assumption that proving damage in a ‘general sense’ is an onerous burden upon the suffering party who may be unable to place evidence for arriving at an exact quantum. In such situations, the courts should examine the terms of the contract to understand the extent to which the clause containing the genuine pre-estimate of damages contemplates the possibility of such breach along with determining the underlying intention of the parties for inclusion of such clause, which would enable the courts to distinguish such provisions from a penalty, the aim of which is to extract compensation which exceeds the degree of losses actually suffered by a party. A contract identifies and allocates risks between parties. Breach of contract means that the party claiming loss would be required to prove the same – which is something a party might want to anticipate in advance and provide for. It is here that the inclusion of a sum stipulating for payment on breach serves as an important tool for certainty and speedy resolution. In context of the commercial wisdom of the parties, the courts must always proceed on a rebuttable presumption favouring a clause which was negotiated keeping in view the complexities of a contract, in which case the interference by courts is merited only when prima facie evidence is established that the clause stipulating genuine pre-estimate of damages is in fact in the nature of penalty. Considering the departure made by Cavendish from the traditional liquidated damages-penalty dichotomy under the English law, scope of amendment remains in Indian law to in fact return to the ‘original’ intent of the legislature which had sought to ‘eliminate the elaborate reﬁnements’ between liquidated damages and penalty by using a neutral term ‘stipulated sums’. The idea is to minimise judicial interference to protect the contractual autonomy of parties who negotiated the inclusion of a clause stipulating genuine pre-estimate of damages. A conservative approach towards courts’ exercise of jurisdiction to override contractual clause would allow the parties to preserve the sanctity of an agreement which constitutes a fundamental aspect of contractual law.

            "Balancing Contractual Autonomy vis-à-vis Application of Section 74 of the Contract Act, 1872: Part I By GuestJuly 17, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Lavanya Pathak and Pallavi Mishra are advocates practicing at the Delhi High Court.] The concept of ‘liquidated damages’ and ‘penalty’ was originally intended to be omitted from the realm of the Indian law by careful usage of the phrase “sum named in the contract” under section 74 of the Contract Act, 1872 (“Contract Act”). However, following the amendment brought about in 1899, the scope of section 74 was enlarged with the introduction of the phrase “or…any other stipulation by way of penalty”. While it appears that the intent of the amendment was to continue to refrain from introducing the English law distinction between liquidated damages and penalty, the Indian courts by implication have overridden the inherent legislative intent by interpreting the section in a manner which in fact did bring the Indian law at par with the English law [Shivprasad Swaminathan, ‘De-inventing the Wheel: Liquidated Damages’, Penalties and the Indian Contract Act, 1872’ (2018) Vol. 6 No. 1 The Chinese Journal of Comparative Law 103-127]. Recently, the judgements handed down by High Courts (discussed below) have revisited the law settled by the Supreme Court (“SC”) in ONGC v. Saw Pipes (“Saw Pipes”) and Kailash Nath Associates v. Delhi Development Authority (“Kailash Nath”). The article analyses the judicial precedents to understand the incorporation of English law principles within the scope of section 74 and further examines (i) whether the requirement to lead evidence of ‘loss suffered’ in cases where the contract itself stipulates a provision for stipulated sums as a genuine pre-estimate of loss defeats the legislative intent; and (ii) whether contractual autonomy has in fact been compromised with the courts interpreting and awarding ‘reasonable compensation’ to deny parties the benefit of a clause incorporated as a genuine pre-estimate of damages. Concept of Damages under Section 74 of the Contract Act Section 74 declares the law regarding liability upon breach of contract where compensation is pre-determined by way of an agreement between the parties, or where there is a stipulation by way of penalty. For ease of reference, the provision is reproduced hereunder: “74. Compensation for breach of contract where penalty stipulated for:- When a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the party who has broken the contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named or, as the case may be, the penalty stipulated for. Explanation.— A stipulation for increased interest from the date of default may be a stipulation by way of penalty.” As early as in Fateh Chand v. Balkishan Dass (“Fateh Chand”), the Constitution Bench of the SC sought to distinguish Indian and common law on damages, clarifying that the former had attempted to ‘eliminate the elaborate refinements’ made under the English law. While interpreting section 74, the judgement delineated the scope of the provision into two classes of cases: (i) where the contract names a pre-determined sum to be paid in case of breach and (ii) where the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty. However, as Swaminathan argues, on a careful reading of Fateh Chand, it is evident that the judgement in fact ended up bringing in the liquidated damages-penalty dichotomy into Indian law, though the term ‘liquidated damages’ itself was not used [op cit Swaminathan]. Justice Shah read “whether or not actual damage or loss is proved” as merely dispensing with the ‘proof’ of loss, and, not loss itself, justifying the award of ‘reasonable compensation’ in the case of breach of a stipulation by way of penalty. Interestingly, Justice Shah grounded the denial of payment stating that the “(d)uty not to enforce the penalty clause but only to award reasonable compensation is statutorily imposed upon courts by Section 74”. This reasoning, far from ‘eliminat[ing] elaborate refinements’, set the scene for departing from the legislative intent of avoiding the liquidated damages-penalty dichotomy under the Indian law. Following Fateh Chand, a 3-judge bench of the SC in Maula Bux v. UoI (“Maula Bux”) acknowledged the fact that in some cases it may be impossible for the court to assess compensation, in which case, the sum named in the contract should be regarded “as the measure of reasonable compensation, but not if the sum named is in the nature of penalty”. Justice Shah reaffirmed the line of argument as was taken in Fateh Chand, thereby incidentally making the liquidated damages-penalty dichotomy a part of the Indian law, without actually employing the term ‘liquidated damages’ [op cit Swaminathan at 112-113]. The modern summary of the law on the point is provided by ONGC v. Saw Pipes. Justice MB Shah stated that where parties have agreed for recovery by way of inclusion of a clause stipulating genuine pre-estimated liquidated damages, the courts should refrain from interfering unless it arrives at a conclusion that the clause contemplating damages is by way of penalty. Besides adjudicating the matter along the lines of the liquidated damages-penalty dichotomy introduced by Fateh Chand and Maula Bux, Saw Pipes cautioned the courts from categorising as penalty the clauses which presented an agreement executed by experts in the field. The SC held that the party was entitled to the stipulated sum without any proof of loss as the contractual clause was in the nature of ‘liquidated damages’, which was a genuine pre-estimate of damage. At this point, there is no doubt that the liquidated damages and penalty were deemed as two different categories squarely applying the English law principles, which the drafters of the Contract Act had originally sought to do away with [op cit Swaminathan at 113]. Following the judicial trend, the reluctance of courts to interfere and exercise jurisdiction over disputes concerning award of liquidated damages in cases arising out of contract was authoritatively laid down in BSNL v. Reliance Communications (“BSNL”). Chief Justice Kapadia placed reliance on Chitty on Contracts to understand the test to be applied to distinguish a clause stipulating genuine pre-estimate of damages from penalty clauses. The judgement inter alia noted that whether a provision is to be treated as a penalty is a matter of construction to be resolved by asking whether at the time the contract was entered into, the ‘predominant contractual function’ of the provision was to deter a party from breaking the contract or to compensate the innocent party for the breach. Further, in Construction and Design Services v. DDA (“DDA”), the SC while squarely applying the categorical pronouncement in Saw Pipes, held that loss could be assumed even without proof and the burden was on the alleging party to prove that the clause stipulating pre-determined damages was in the nature of penalty.  Flowing from section 74, the above precedents clearly demonstrate a judicial practice of distinguishing and categorising damages as ‘penalty clauses’ or ‘clauses stipulating genuine pre-estimate of damages.’ Given the circumstances, usually in complex contractual relationships, parties stipulate a sum to be paid in the eventuality of breach of the contract. Typically, the understanding between the parties is that such a clause encapsulates a reasonable estimate of anticipated or actual losses suffered on account of breach of the contract. The latest in the line of prominent precedents discussing the issue of liquidated damages and penalty under section 74 is Kailash Nath, where the SC seeks to codify and re-state the underlying principles of this area of law. It may be noted that while in Saw Pipes, BSNL and DDA the SC appears to be guarded in policing stipulated sums unless they are in terrorem, Kailash Nath tilts the scale towards stringent assessment of reasonableness of compensation making it a “sine qua non” for award of damages under section 74. Justice Nariman specifically referring to the phrase “whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby” held that the proof of damage is not dispensed with where it is possible to lead evidence establishing actual damage or loss. Thus, Kailash Nath seems to deviate from Saw Pipes in as much as “…compensation can only be given for damage or loss suffered. If damage or loss is not suffered, the law does not provide for a windfall”. The resulting position is that even in cases where the parties negotiate the insertion of a clause keeping in view an anticipatory breach of contract and estimated losses, the court requires the party to prove the damage suffered, thereby tilting the burden upon the suffering party to prima facie establish loss rather than the breaching party leading evidence to establish absence of damage or penal nature of the clause.   [continued in Part II] – Lavanya Pathak & Pallavi Mishra Contract Law"

            "CCI’s Inconsistent Stance on Acquisition of Optionally Convertible Securities: Reconciling Control and Competition By GuestJuly 10, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Arham Anwar and Ruby Agrawal are 4th year and 2nd year students of NLU Jodhpur and RGNUL Patiala] The scheme of arrangements contemplated under the Companies Act, 2013 generally requires the approval of the Competition Commission of India (hereinafter, “CCI”) in relation to asset size and turnover of the enterprise. This essentially underlines high level of dependability the company has on the CCI before taking any decision pertaining to its interests. Section 6(2) of the Competition Act, 2002 (hereinafter, “Act”) provides that any corporation proposing to enter into an arrangement shall give noticeto the CCI, within 30 days of approval of the restructuring proposals. It is axiomatic that the scheme of the Act has a pre–requisite for an acquisition of control, shares, voting rights or assets which areto be reported to the CCI when an agreement providing for an arrangement is executed between the parties and the parties to the transaction exceed specific financial thresholds as specified under The Competition Act, 2002. The Companies Act of 2013 also established Optionally Convertible Debentures (OCDs) which are optionally convertible securities as a new financial tool for raising capital in business. Companies have the option to convert their Optionally Convertible Debentures, subject to certain circumstances, into shares of equity at a later time. In contrast to compulsorily convertible debentures, the conversion of OCDs is optional and may be undertaken at the holder’s discretion or in accordance with a mutually agreed-upon arrangement hence providing flexibility to the investors holding such OCDs. Analyzing the CCI’s stance with respect to acquisition of convertible securities, it has been made clear that the parties to the saidtransaction require clearance from the CCI at the time of acquisition of the said security. However notification to the CCI at the timeof actual conversion of the security is not mandated. An important caveat here is that, the natural fluctuations in the market and even the control structure of the target entity might vary greatly within the time frame of the acquisition of the convertible security and the date of conversion of the security. This holds true for both securities that can be converted either optionally or compulsorily.  However, if there is a juxtaposition with an option to acquire securities rather than the actual acquisition of securities, the prompt for the time of notification to the CCI differs greatly and is distinguished in case of securities which are optionally convertible. Conundrum in the CCI’s position There has been a schism between the CCI’s varying stances with respect to acquisition of optionally convertible securities.Firstly, analyzing the Bharti decision,[1] the restructuring proposal contemplated the acquisition of 57% shareholding by Reliance Industries Limited and 17% shareholding by Reliance Industrial Infrastructure Limited in Bharti AXA Life Insurance CompanyLimited, respectively. The remaining 26% shareholding was retained by Bharti AXA. Within the corpus of the transaction, the relevant limb to this analysis was that, AXA had an option to acquire 24% shareholding in Bharti, from Reliance IndustriesLimited at a later date. Here, the CCI denied clearance for the optional and potential acquisition of shares. Since the optionalacquisition cannot be considered a part of the present arrangement, the CCI was of the opinion that potential acquisition of securities would be assessed for approval at the time of actual acquisition of said securities. However, there was a substantial shift in the CCI’s position regarding acquisition of optionally convertible securities which could be extrapolated from the CCI’s order in the assessment of the arrangement proposal of Independent Media Trust[2] for the acquisition of zero coupon optionally convertible debentures. The proposed transaction stipulated that the holders of such optionally convertible debentures had the prerogative to convert the said debentures into equity shares at any time within 10 years ofsubscription. Here, the CCI shifted from its own precedent and cleared the proposed arrangement, rather than assessing the debentures at the actual time of conversion. This hiatus is unaccounted for, and the dissonance in the reception of securities thatare convertible at the holder’s prerogative must be treated. A number of issues arise from such shift in the stance. First, the very fact that the holder has the option to convert such debentures into equity shares even when the actual conversion is distant in future provides the possibility of exercising control over management decisions (or, to draw from the phrase used in relation to hostile takeovers under Delaware law, the “omnipresent specter”). Such control is acquired with the acquisition of OCDs and does not defer until the actual conversion takes place thus pushing the boundaries of how control is defined under the Act, and if rigidly followed, can even have unanticipated repercussions. Second, it draws attention to the inconsistencies between the definitions of control and share acquisition under the competition and takeover laws, which are governed by CCI and SEBI, respectively. Such discrepancy can be easily noted in the role of acquisition of voting rights under both laws, variation in the timing regarding with when the triggers operate under the two statutes. Some of the above issues will make arrangement of significant takeover transactions more difficult and may make both sets of rules applicable simultaneously.  Another problem is that The Combination Regulations, 2011 require parties to submit a single merger notification that covers all of the transaction components in a multi-step transaction that are planned by the parties to achieve the transaction’s final goal. Notably, the existence and specifics of the option must be disclosed to the CCI if the purchase of an option is being considered in conjunction with a standard notifiable transaction. A notifiable composite transaction (which consists of numerous steps making up the complete transaction) is often certified in its entirety by the CCI under the provisions of the Act and its related regulations. When a composite transaction has components that are deemed to be inseparably linked to the main transaction, the CCI’s approval is normally not delayed. The Independent Media Trust decision’s guiding concept in this regard harmonizes the interconnection rules’ business realities with them. The purchase of an optional instrument may be evaluated and approved along with any linked notifiable steps under the framework of the Independent Media Trust decision. Under the stance supported by the Bharti judgement, it would not be permissible to apply this strategy since, under the Bharti decision design, the CCI is required to disregard a notified step (including alternatives) and cause it to be assessed at a later time. Divergent Reconciliation The CCI has been employing an approach which can be best described as a ‘pendulum approach’ in its stance regarding theacquisition of convertible securities and their assessment. In the arrangement process of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited,[3] theCCI assessed and approved the potential acquisition of such securities, thus diluting its original position. However, a significantaddition was made in order to harmonize its approach when the CCI provided for a time frame to exercise the option ofconversion. The CCI’s attempt at harmonization subsequently failed as it rejected the arrangement proposition of Axis Bank to acquire shares in Max Life, at a later date. However, in 2021, the CCI had assessed and granted approval to an optional acquisition ofsecurities within five years from the primary acquisition in the scheme of arrangement between Sumitomo Mitsui FinancialGroup and Fullerton India Credit Company Limited. Subsequently, in the Ola cases the CCI only approved the primary transaction and posited that the notice regarding potential acquisition of securities at a later date would only be assessed at thestipulated date. Conclusion The CCI has not maintained a consistent stance regarding acquisition of optionally convertible securities, as can be extrapolatedfrom its various assessments. While the stance in the most recent assessments swing towards the original position laid down in the Bharti decision, a clear reconciliation is sacrosanct. The issue primarily arises because optionally convertible securitiescreate a legal right, but only at a prospective date, which has the potential to impact the findings of the CCI’s assessments,as the assessment is not in real time, but a contemplation of future market scenarios. Hence the acquisition of optionally convertible securities may be permitted or prohibited by the CCI depending on the particulars of each situation. The CCI assesses transactions individually and takes into account elements including market concentration, entry hurdles, and the potential for anti-competitive coordination among rivals. The CCI may step in to remedy the issues if it is determined that the acquisition of optionally convertible securities will considerably lessen competition, for example by establishing a dominant market position or preventing entry by new rivals. This intervention can entail putting restrictions on the deal or, in severe circumstances, blocking the acquisition altogether. There have been multiple occasions where the CCI has authorized a transaction leg that is conditional upon the occurrence of a future contingency, despite the fact that the CCI typically avoids approving transaction steps that are not fully crystallized. It might be argued that approval of a transaction does not necessarily depend on a transaction step being final. Therefore, the CCI’s willingness to allow ZOCDs (Zero Coupon Optionally Convertible Debentures) serves as evidence that a transaction step does not need to be approved with 100% confidence. Using an analogy, there is probably no reason why an option should not be treated equally to optionally convertible instruments as long as it is adequately specified in terms of its duration, scope, and operation. The stated inconsistency in the stance not only creates ambiguity but also decreases predictability of the merger clearance process by treating options and optionally convertible securities differently. The CCI must bring uniformity to its assessments. A steptowards the realization of uniformity was the inclusion of the time frame paradigm, as was laid down in the assessment of the Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited arrangement. A return to the original position of the Bharti case would bring uniformity in CCI’s assessments and would also ensure that the assessments are not tainted due to market fluctuations and other contingencies, thusreconciling the double – layered conundrum. The Competition Act has seen a number of changes since it was first passed, including inclusion of provisions for mergers and acquisitions in 2007 and tougher penalties for anti-competitive action in 2009. Another amendment bill that seeks to improve enforcement practices and impose stiffer penalties for disregarding CCI rulings is approved by both Houses of Parliament in 2023. Hence a firm stance could be taken by CCI in the 2023 amendment bill as if passed; this Bill could significantly impact the operations of large corporations in India and create a more equitable playing field for all businesses. – Arham Anwar and Ruby Agrawal   [1] 2011 SCC Online CCI 95 [2] 2012 SCC Online CCI 76 [3] 2017 SCC Online CCI 117 Competition Act Competition Law"

        "read_on_content": [
            "Fine-Tuning the FLDG Framework: Sectoral Caps Reflecting Default Rate Variations By GuestJuly 1, 20237 Min readAdd comment   [Ritvij Ratn Tiwari is a 3rd-year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) student at the National Law School of India University, Bangalore.] In June 2023, the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) issued guidelines regulating the arrangements for sharing the losses arising from defaulted loans, popularly called default loss guarantee (“DLG”), between regulated entities (“REs”) and lending service providers (“LSPs”). These guidelines also encompass arrangements between two REs. These guidelines are critical for operationalizing “fintech” lending in India which generally involves agreements among REs themselves or between REs on the one hand and LSPs on the other. Under the fintech lending business model, LSPs act as agents of REs and carry out one or more of the lender’s functions such as customer acquisition, recovery, servicing, etc. The guidelines mandate the fulfilling of various conditions, key ones being a five percent cap on the DLG and the obligation of regulatory entities (REs) of identifying and provisioning for individual loan assets within their portfolio as non-performing assets (“NPAs”) to implement first loss default guarantee (“FLDG”). This post argues that although the RBI guidelines provide crucial regulatory standards, they neglect to take into account the important element of sectoral default rates, employing a generalized approach that overlooks sector specific nuances. This piece discusses the unique arrangement of FDLG and unpacks the arguments supporting and opposing a fixed default cap. It then seeks to make a case for applying sectoral caps on default loss guarantee by LSPs on the basis of sector specific default rates. The Arrangement of FLDG Collaborations with fintech firms are becoming increasingly crucial for traditional banks as they strive to foster growth through innovation and maintain relevance within a dynamic and rapidly changing market environment. Similarly, for fintech platforms, lending is one of the top sources of revenue.  FLDG is a contractual arrangement under which an LSP guarantees to compensate the RE, loss due to loan default up to a certain percentage of the loan portfolio of the RE, specified upfront. FLDG, thus, is one of the most important contractual arrangements between a fintech company acting as an LSP and a RE such as a bank or an NBFC. Under the FLDG arrangement, the LSP effectively cushions the RE against the first loss up to a certain level. REs are, however, obligated to adhere to existing standards pertaining to ownership, accountability, credit underwriting, credit risk management policies, regulatory capital requirements, asset classification, provisioning, and due diligence over the LSPs. The guidelines also mandate that the LSP must disclose information on their websites through a mechanism established by the RE. This mechanism entails publishing the total number of portfolios and the corresponding amount of each portfolio on which DLG has been provided. This ensures that the entire process is transparent and subject to scrutiny by competitors, thereby promoting a climate of healthy competition. The Fixed Five Percent Default Cover The guidelines stipulate a hard limit of five percent of the amount lent as the default cover. On the one hand, it is arguedthat a default cover of five percent is well justified as it makes sure that REs do not shirk off their responsibility of underwriting. It assures that REs are doing what is required and ensures that borrowers are not being subjected to predatory practices. Finally, it makes sure that fintech LSPs are not at a greater risk of bearing the burden in cases of default.  On the other hand, it can also be argued that a default cover of five percent is low and an increment will enable access to credit to the fintech platforms. It also instils greater trust among REs due to greater commitment and involvement in lending by fintech platforms as they have more skin in the game. However, if one sees the underlying idea behind these two arguments, it is evident that the entire game of guarantee is based on the delicate balance between ensuring responsible underwriting and fostering access to credit for fintech firms. The variable of default rate comes into play here. The greater the propensity to default in a sector, the lesser will be the tendency of the fintech platforms to advance FLDG. Sectoral Cap on the Basis of Default Rates When providing FLDG, it is crucial to assess and understand the default rates for several reasons. Default rates help in assessing the level of risk associated while providing a guarantee. By analyzing historical default rates, fintech platforms can evaluate the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on their obligations. This assessment can help them determine whether they can afford to provide the guarantee and at what cost. Thus, fintech platforms might only extend a five percent default cover to a specific sector while it might be wise for them to extend a default cover of 50 percent in a sector with low default rates. For instance, in India, default rates among micro small and medium industries (“MSMEs”) are lower than large corporations. Similarly, the default rates in the microfinance sector have been decreasing whereas they are on the rise in the education sector. Overall, sector-specific default rates tend to follow business cycles, reflecting the broader economic conditions and dynamics within each sector. While some sectors exhibit lower default rates due to specific characteristics or effective risk management practices, others may face challenges that lead to higher default rates. Recognizing these cyclical patterns is crucial for fintech platforms, to appropriately assess and manage risks associated with different sectors. It is argued that implementing a fixed cap of five percent is inadequate and fails to consider the varying characteristics of different sectors and business cycles. By extending FDLG in sectors characterized by lower default rates, fintech firms have the opportunity to secure credit and enhance their lending activity. To address this issue, two potential solutions can be considered. First, the RBI could consider increasing the default cap to a higher percentage range of 20-30 percent. This would provide greater flexibility for fintech firms to access credit while still maintaining a reasonable level of risk mitigation. Secondly, the RBI could establish a list of sectoral caps, based on historical and current default rates within each sector. By tailoring the default cover percentages according to the specific risk profiles of different sectors, the RBI can ensure a more targeted and balanced approach to risk management in fintech lending partnerships. The RBI may also choose to revise this list on a periodic basis without affecting previous loans.  Conclusion The implementation of the FDLG guidelines can be regarded as a significant achievement that fosters innovation and expansion within the lending sector without causing major disruptions. The RBI has made serious efforts to facilitate fintech and innovation benefiting from digital lending on one end, and on the other, maintaining its standards to ensure no systemic risk by re-emphasising that the obligations of the RE are not diluted in the process. However, a strict cap applied in a broad-brush fashion disregards the diversity in sectors. Interestingly, in the wake of the pandemic, more than ten percent of borrowers did not repay their loans leading the fintech lenders to have massive commitments towards banks. If there had been a sectoral assessment of default rates and subsequent sectoral caps, such a fiasco could have been prevented. The RBI can view this as a valuable lesson and a chance to establish a mechanism for incorporating the standard of sectoral default rates in the FLDG framework. This is especially important considering that the acknowledgement of FLDG is a relatively recent development. – Ritvij Ratn Tiwari Banking Financial Markets RBI Regulation"

            "Section 241 of the Companies Act, 2013: An Avenue for Derivative Actions By GuestJune 29, 202312 Min readAdd comment   [Rakshit Agarwal is a 2nd Year Student at the National Law School of India University, Bangalore] The judgment of the Delhi High Court in ICP Investments v Uppal Housing Pvt Ltd has spurred the debate as to whether section 241 of the Companies Act 2013 (“Act”) is the appropriate provision under which derivative actions can be instituted. The decision in ICP Investments to include derivative actions within section 241 of the Companies Act has been supported by the finding of the Madras High Court in Valluvar Kuzhumam v APC Drilling & Construction. This is a marked deviation from the presence of derivative actions within common law, as was the position earlier. Although there has been scholarship criticizing these judgments as they deviate from common law,  I argue that the finding of the Delhi High Court is sound in law. I first examine the language of sections 241 and 242 and then analyze the concurrent position in the United Kingdom (UK) as contained under the Companies Act 2006. I then argue that permitting section 241 to govern derivative actions is in the interests of minority shareholders.  Section 241 Encompasses Derivative Actions Although section 241 is similar to its predecessor, namely section 397 of the Companies Act, 1956, there is a marked deviation in the language of section 241 in the 2013 Act. In the latter legislation, a suit for oppression or prejudice can be initiated when the company’s affairs are being conducted against its interests. This is different from the Companies Act, 1956, where oppression or unfair prejudice could be initiated only when the shareholders’ interests were adversely affected. An action under section 241 can be instituted when the company’s interests are affected, implying that redressing a personal wrong or the presence of personal injury is not the sine qua non to bring a suit. The change in the language led the Court in ICP Investments to infer that derivative actions can be included within section 241. The fundamental purpose of derivative actions is to accord a remedy to the company when its management is being conducted against its interests. An observation and analysis of the remedies available under section 242 reveal that they are largely in the company’s favour. Setting aside company agreements or agreements entered into between a company and its directors under section 242(2)(e) contemplates situations that have arisen in common law derivative actions such as Daniels v Daniels [1978] Ch 406, where the controlling directors sold to themselves the company’s assets at an undervalued rate. In this case, the Court ultimately held that the minority shareholders had standing to bring about such a cause of action as the directors had breached their duties towards the company. The removal of the directors and the recovery of undue gains made by the directors under section 242(2)(i) contemplates situations that have arisen in common law derivative actions, such as those in Cook v. Deeks, where the respondents obtained a contract in their name rather than the company’s. The Court held that since the benefit of the contract belonged to the company, the directors could not use their power to misappropriate funds. The tribunal has also been provided with the power to end matters complained of and make just and equitable orders under sections 242(1) and 242(2)(m), effectively covering situations not contemplated by other remedies. Thus, section 241 can encompass derivative actions. Thus, the statute contemplates situations that arose in common law derivative actions, ensuring that it forms an adequate replacement for the same in Indian law. I will now proceed to rebut arguments made against the inclusion of derivative actions within s 241. Although the legislature did not intend to include derivative actions within the ambit of section 241, the courts are not bound to rely on the same. It can rely on the rule against surplusage, which holds that words of a provision or legislation should be read in a manner such that redundancy of any part can be avoided. Reading in derivative actions under section 241 gives effect to the words “interests of the company” and can thus be used to prevent redundancy. The same is also beneficial to minority shareholders and serves a dual purpose, which will be established in the next section. While the judgments of Singapore such as that in Ng Kek Wee v Sim City Technology Ltd have been relied upon by scholars to argue that the words “interests of the company” can be used to initiate direct actions when the interests of shareholders as members of the company have been prejudiced, the same should not be relied on. This is because the relevant provision, namely section 216 of the Companies Act of Singapore, is in respect of “personal remedies in cases of oppression or injustice”. However, the explanatory note to section 241 of the Companies Act, 2013 does not specify or indicate that it is in the nature of a personal remedy. Thus, the interpretation accorded based on the holding of the Singapore Courts does not necessarily imply that section 241 is restricted to direct actions. The UK has Interpreted Derivative Actions as a Part of Similar Remedies Unlike its predecessor legislation, the Companies Act 2006 of the UK contains an explicit chapter that codifies and recognizes statutory derivative actions. Part 11 recognizes the right of shareholders to institute shareholder derivative actions in respect of any breach of negligence or trust by a director of the company. Under section 260(2), the Court recognizes the institution of a derivative claim under section 994 of the Act, which is the remedy against unfair prejudice. Section 994 authorizes a member of the company to apply to the court when the acts of the company are being carried out in a manner prejudicial to: (a) the interests of the members or; (b) the actions of the company are prejudicial in general. Despite the tendency to read the first part as meaning direct actions, I will demonstrate that derivative actions can be instituted under both parts of the section. It is to be noted that the first part of the provision is in pari materia to section 459 of the Companies Act 1985. Under this provision, substantive corporate relief can be obtained through an unfair prejudice petition. In Clark v Cutland, the Court consolidated unfair prejudice and derivative actions under the said provision and granted the company £1.1 million in relief. In Re A Company [1986] BCLC 68, it rejected the contentions of the respondents that a suit in the nature of a derivative action cannot be brought about under section 459 of the Companies Act 1985. The same interpretation of law applies to its successor section 994. The wording of the second part of the section expands the ambit of section 459 as a suit can be instituted for prejudice in general. Its wording is similar to that of section 241, which authorizes a suit for oppression and mismanagement when the acts are prejudicial to the “interests of the company.” I thus argue that bearing in mind the similarity and generality in the wording of the provisions, section 241 ought to be interpreted in a manner conducive to including derivative actions within its ambit. Further, section 242 of the Indian Companies Act is similarly worded to section 996 of the UK Act, which has been used in the UK to grant substantive corporate relief, in that it permits the court to give relief as it deems fit. This expansive provision can account for relief given in the form of derivative actions. Thus, derivative actions can be instituted under section 241 Although the UK has a specific chapter dedicated to derivative actions, the absence of the same in India should not be a hindrance to including derivative actions under section 241. This is for three reasons. First, a plain reading of section 241 explained above indicates that an action can be brought when the company’s interests are prejudiced or oppressed. There is no specific requirement for prejudice to the instituting shareholder for an action to be instituted. Second, the wide scope of remedies available under section 242 provides the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) an avenue to grant substantive corporate relief to the minority shareholders. Third, the same would ensure the adequate protection of minority shareholders, which is elaborated on in the next section. Thus, the absence of an exhaustive chapter for derivative action under the Indian legislation does not bar the inclusion of such actions under section 241. I will now elaborate why the same is desirable in the next section. The Judgment is in the Interests of Minority Shareholders Although I have used the wide scope of remedies as a reason to include derivative actions within section 241, the same acts in the favour of minority shareholders as well. The entire purpose of permitting derivative actions as an exception to the proper plaintiff rule laid down in Foss v Harbottle (1843) 2 Hare 461 was to ensure that the interests of the minority shareholders are safeguarded, in that they act as a manifestation of the company in protecting it against the tyranny of the majority.      The judgment of ICP Investments is in the interests of minority shareholders for two reasons. Firstly, it is a welcome move away from common law. Secondly, it provides an avenue where direct and derivative actions can be consolidated and brought under a singular provision.  As observed by the Law Commission of the UK, derivative actions in common law are virtually inaccessible as it derives from a plethora of precedents over 150 years. It has also been described as “inflexible and outmoded” and “complex and obscure”. For instance, a derivative action can be instituted only when the wrongdoers have de jure control, which Pavlides v Jensen [1956] Ch 565 has interpreted to mean a simple majority of the total voting shares. However, the same cannot be instituted when the wrongdoers may not have a voting majority but de facto control. This is especially important for shareholders in companies that are not closely held. However, an action under section 241 can be brought in this situation, ensuring that the company’s interests remain at the forefront of things. To prove fraud on the minority, which is one ground under which a derivative suit can be initiated in common law, it must also be shown that the wrongdoers’ actions benefited them Daniels v Daniels [1978] Ch 406). This becomes a hindrance in protecting the company’s interests. The very fact that a mere 10 derivative actions have succeeded or been granted leave in India goes to show the difficulties that have been put forth on petitioners before relief or leave is granted to them. Section 241 is far more flexible with fewer requirements for leave and a greater breadth of protection available to minority shareholders. A petitioner is merely required to approach the NCLT with a minimum shareholding requirement. Although this is docked at 10%, an application for a waiver can be made before the NCLT under section 244(1) of the Act and has been permitted by courts, such as in Cyrus Investments v Tata Sons. This ensures that common law does not hinder the company’s interests.  Although it may be argued that this inclusion would vitiate the proper plaintiff principle laid down in Foss, it is prudent to note that Indian courts have cast doubt on the watertight rule of Foss. In ICICI v Parasrampuria Synthetic Ltd, the Delhi High Court opined that the rule must not be mechanically applied to the Indian context. Unlike the UK, where the shareholding is largely disbursed among a vast number of small shareholders, ownership is rather closely held among a few individuals in India. Thus, a mechanical application of the Foss rule would severely jeopardize the interests of minority shareholders which, as demonstrated above, is key to the company’s interests. My second argument is that the multiplicity of proceedings is automatically reduced as a result of section 241. The line between derivative and direct actions is blurred as the same cause of action may violate personal and corporate rights. As observed in Raj Kumar Sethi v Spark Dealers Pvt Ltd 2008 SCC OnLine Cal 587 [57], derivative actions are mistakenly brought to redress personal wrongs. This increases the suits filed as separate actions need to be brought under section 241 before the NCLT and derivative actions in common law before the civil courts. Considering that a cause of action may give rise to both kinds of actions, the multiplicity of litigation inconveniences petitioners. Consolidation of proceedings under section 241 reduces the challenges associated with separating the two suits. The Court in Re A Company observed that the separation of actions would involve unnecessary duplication of proceedings. It thus awarded damages to the company and the plaintiff shareholders under the same remedy. Considering that section 241 permits an action to be brought in the company’s interests and there are a wide range of remedies available under section 242, such as those that give the NCLT the power to make an order to bring to an “end the matters complained of” under section 242(1), direct and derivative actions can be consolidated and remedies can be granted in respect of both.  Conclusion The move towards section 241 is not only justified but also practical and sound for minority shareholders. In this post, I have listed three main arguments to prove that section 241 encompasses derivative actions. I have argued that the language of section 241 is wide enough to cover derivative actions. I then argued that the UK courts have interpreted their unfair prejudice remedy to cover derivative actions. I lastly argue for using section 241 to mean derivative actions are in the interests of minority shareholders as it deviates from common law and involves a consolidation of proceedings. – Rakshit Agarwal Companies Act Company Law Corporate Litigation"

            "SEBI’s Order on Spoofing – A Way Forward By GuestJune 27, 20236 Min readAdd comment   [Shivangi Paliwal and Mahak Shinghal are final year B.A. LL.B. (IPR Hons.) and B.B.A. LL.B. (IPR Hons.) students at National Law University, Jodhpur] Section 12A of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 [“SEBI Act”] read along with Regulation 3 & 4 of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 [“PFUTP Regulations”] prohibits any person from engaging in fraudulent and unfair trade practices through the use of any manipulative device, insider trading, and substantial acquisition of securities or control. In March 2021, SEBI issued a circular on “Order-based Surveillance Method-Persistent Noise Creators” [“Circular”] to address the issue of excessive modification and cancellation of orders placed on exchanges. If excessive order modification and cancellation lead to market manipulation i.e., when a trader creates a false appearance of market activity by entering multiple non-bona fide orders on one side of the market, at generally increasing (or decreasing) prices, in order to move that stock’s price in a direction where the trader intends to induce others to buy (or sell) at a price altered by the non-bona fide orders, it is referred to as “Spoofing” around the world. Recently, SEBI passed an order regarding the trading activities of Nimi Enterprises wherein, it introduced the term “spoofing” for the first time, to describe the actions undertaken by Nimi Enterprises. In the order, SEBI defined Spoofing as “the unlawful practice of placing orders containing a large number of shares on one side of the market (buy/sell) and eventually executing orders containing relatively smaller quantities of shares on the opposite side (sell/buy) and cancelling the orders containing large orders.” The practice of spoofing is intended to create an artificial impression of pressure on one side of the market by placing large sized orders without any intention to execute them. The large sized orders create the impression of demand on that side of the market (buy/ sell) inducing other traders to also place orders on that side (buy/sell) of the order book. Ruling in the Nimi Enterprises Order Nimi Enterprises, a company engaged in securities trading in India, was under investigation for its trading activities to ascertain whether they were in contravention of the provisions of the SEBI Act and the PFUTP Regulations. During the investigation, SEBI found that Nimi Enterprises had engaged in a pattern of trading that created an artificial impression of demand or supply for certain scrips. Specifically, Nimi Enterprises would place a large order for a security at a price substantially different from the prevailing market price. It would then place another order for the same security at a price closer to the market price but for a smaller quantity of shares. After executing this second order, they would cancel the first order containing a larger number of shares. Thereafter, based on this revelation, a Show Cause Notice [“SCN”] was served upon the Noticees. Nimi Enterprises contended that the intention behind placing numerous large buy and sell orders and executing them with some orders being at prices higher or lower than the prevailing market price is based on the expectation that the price would increase or decrease due to various factors. However, some of the large orders were not executed and later cancelled in order to utilize the margin for trading in other stocks. Additionally, they asserted that they did not comprehend the term “spoofing” as mentioned in the SCN, nor was this term defined under any SEBI regulations. They further argued that they demonstrated their intention to execute the orders by fully disclosing them to the market participants, as a trader who does not wish to execute their order would not disclose it. Thus, there was no evidence to suggest any fraudulent intent behind the alleged trades. The main point of contention for SEBI was whether the trading pattern by Nimi Enterprises was in violation of the provisions of sections 12 A (a),(b),(c) of the SEBI Act and regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a) and (g) of the PFUTP Regulations. SEBI, in its order, observed that the time difference between the execution of small orders and the cancellation of large orders was only a matter of seconds and this pattern was observed for several scrips on several trading days. This factual revelation exposed the recurring modus operandi employed by Nimi Enterprises as a customary trading practice. Moreover, SEBI highlighted the norms of the Stock Exchanges requiring traders to disclose either a percentage of their total order to the market participants, which should not be less than 10% of the total quantity, or the entire quantity itself. Once the disclosed quantity is converted into trades, an additional quantity equivalent to 10% of the total ordered quantity becomes visible on the Order book. SEBI found that Nimi Enterprises intentionally fully disclosed the large orders placed by them in the Order book, on the other hand, when executing trades involving relatively smaller quantities in those same scrips, they chose to disclose only partial quantities of shares. This factual matrix led SEBI to conclude that Nimi Enterprises placed the large orders without any intention to execute them and with a malicious intent to manipulate the price and volume of the scrip as they were able to buy or sell shares at prices which were determined based on non-genuine demand/supply inherent in those scrips, thereby harming the interests of other genuine investors in the securities market. SEBI opined that the trading pattern employed by Nimi Enterprises was in violation of the SEBI Act and the PFUTP Regulations. Thus, SEBI restrained Nimi Enterprises and other individuals from accessing the securities market and prohibited them from engaging in any activities related to buying, selling, or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly, and from being associated with the securities market for a duration of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Additionally, a penalty of Rupees 25 Lakhs was imposed. To both deter and detect spoofing practices, the 2021 Circular required exchanges to implement an additional order-based surveillance measure to deter persistent noise creators i.e., excessive order modifications/cancellations with an intent to avoid execution. Conclusion Market abuse or fraudulent transactions in securities create a lack of clarity, endanger the fairness of the market, and reduce the trust that investors have in the capital market. SEBI’s order along with the Circular is a positive step in achieving market transparency by creating scope for deterrence, detection and reporting of large scale and patterns of order cancellation and spoofing by traders. – Shivangi Paliwal and Mahak Shinghal Information Technology SEBI Securities Regulation"

            "Regulating the Regulator: A Prohibited Territory for the CCI By GuestJune 25, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Shourya Mitra is a penultimate year law student at Jindal Global Law School, Sonipat] On 2 June 2023, the Delhi High Court, in the case of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) v. CCI, held that the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) lacks jurisdiction to assess grievances arising from a statutory regulator’s decisions. It held that the CCI could not compel or outsource functions of a statutory regulator, even if it involves “economic activity”. Although this is not the first case of a statutory regulator being excluded, the Court atypically deemed ICAI as an “enterprise” despite stating that the CCI could not scrutinize its regulatory decisions. This post will analyse the jurisprudence regarding regulators and their treatment within the competition framework. Further, the post will attempt to demonstrate that despite the High Court reaching a fitting conclusion, the approach of holding ICAI as an “enterprise” and still ousting the CCI’s Jurisdiction was unconventional and may require further clarification. Brief Background The matter arose out of an investigation order under section 26(1) of the Competition Act, 2002 (“the Act”) passed by the CCI against the ICAI for prima facie contravening section 4 of the Act. The CCI observed that the ICAI had contravened the provisions of the Act by not allowing non-ICAI recognised bodies to conduct Continuing Professional Education (“CPE”) related learning activities, including seminars. It was alleged that “ICAI was abusing its dominant position as a regulator, to create a monopoly in the service of providing CPE seminars”. The remedy sought was that ICAI should recognise other professional bodies and organisations for conducting seminars that could be included within the learning programs to acquire CPE Credit hours. The High Court perused the Chartered Accountants Act 1949 to understand the powers and functions performed by the ICAI. It then addressed whether ICAI was an “enterprise” under section 2(h) of the Act, as it is a pre-requisite for scrutinizing abuse of dominance under section 4. The ICAI argued that it was carrying out regulatory and not economic activities. Hence, it was not an “enterprise”. The Court determined that ICAI qualified as a “person” providing services related to education, thereby making it an “enterprise”. It further held that despite being formed for a non-economic purpose, ICAI engaged in economic activities, as evidenced by the revenue generated from its Structured Learning Activity program (including CPE). With respect to the “sovereign function” – which is the only statutory exception to “enterprise”- the Court held that ICAI’s educational functions were not sovereign. These functions, even if related to the government’s sovereign functions, were not excluded from “enterprise”. The exclusion only applied to the government’s activities. ICAI, not being “the government”, could not be excluded. The question of jurisdiction came down to whether the alleged abusive conduct could be subject to the CCI’s scrutiny. The High Court, holding in the negative, stated that the CCI could not address grievances arising out of the exercise of“regulatory powers” of the ICAI. Consequently, the ICAI not outsourcing its activities could not be considered an “abuse of dominance”. It observed that ICAI’s decision to mandate its members to undertake structured learning programs offered by it and its affiliates pursuant to its regulatory duties was not reviewable by the CCI. In holding the same, it distinguished between decisions in the capacity of a “regulator” and that of a “service provider”. The informant wanted ICAI to recognize other organizations and bodies offering comparable learning programs for credit hours. The Court observed that this was not a relief within the capacity of the CCI, as it could not turn into an appellate court against such decisions “taken by other regulators, in the exercise of their statutory powers”. The Court also observed that there are no other interchangeable learning activities with the CPE conducted by the ICAI. It held that the CCI had erred in delineating a relevant market “for organizing recognised CP Seminars/workshops/Conferences”. The ICAI, being the standard setter, could not be obliged to outsource its functions and create a market where other entities would be entitled to participate as market players. The author agrees with the High Court’s conclusion as it prevents absurd outcomes such as the CCI adjudicating upon regulatory decisions of other statutory regulators. However, in arriving at the conclusion, the author believes that ICAI should have been exempted as an enterprise, as the same has been the norm for excluding CCI’s jurisdiction. An “Enterprise” Not Subject to Scrutiny The norm for excluding CCI’s jurisdiction under section 4 of the Act has been to remove the concerned body from the ambit of “enterprise” under section 2(h). This involves dwelling into the nature of the body’s duties and functions and contrasting its regulatory functions with its “economic/commercial function”, thereby excluding it from the definition of “enterprise”.  For instance, the Bar Council of India (BCI) was excluded as an enterprise due to its engagement in regulatory activities rather than economic/commercial activities. Similarly, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority(IRDA) was not held as an enterprise due to its engagement in non-economic/regulatory activities. However, in the present case, the ICAI has been held to discharge economic activities and has been held as an enterprise. This raises doubts about the strong emphasis on ICAI’s regulatory function. Regulatory function: An Exclusion?  Emphasizing regulatory functions as a means of exclusion is not unheard of. However, this exclusion has been from the sweep of an “enterprise”. Statutory regulators like BCI and IRDA were excluded as they discharged regulatory and not economic or commercial functions. The High Court, for ICAI, could have applied the same rationale as the IRDA case, which recognized that regulatory actions are excluded from the ambit of “enterprise”. This would have provided stronger jurisprudential support for the ICAI decision. Even in the Director General of Health Services(“DGHS”)  case, the CCI had held that the functions of the DGHS were regulatory and non-economic in nature and hence could not be covered within “enterprise”. However, the COMPAT overturned this on the grounds that “enterprise” only has exceptions concerning “sovereign functions”, which provides for only “primary, inescapable, inalienable and non-delegable functions of a government”. The DGHS discharged functions as a service provider as well. Therefore, being a regulator by itself has not always ousted the jurisdiction of the CCI. For instance, in the case of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the CCI observed that the BCCI had significant control and regulation over the sport of cricket. It emphasized the BCCI’s involvement in economic activity, regardless of its not-for-profit motive, and categorized it as an enterprise. In the case of the All India Chess Federation (AICF), the federation had powers with respect to granting recognition to tournaments conducted by other organisations (akin to ICAI’s recognition powers). The AICF was effectively the sole and exclusive authority to govern the game of chess in India. The CCI noted that it was a “de facto regulator”. However, it went on to recognise it as an enterprise due to the economic activities it discharged despite its regulatory nature. Further, the pervasive control exercised by the AICF led CCI to hold that it was dominant. Similarly, the Amateur Baseball Federation of India (ABFI) was held to be dominant owing to the similar recognition and powers it enjoyed as a regulator of baseball. It was held that its powers constituted regulatory barriers in the sport of baseball as no other body could parallel such pervasive powers. The CCI held that the definition of enterprise was wide enough to capture ABFI within the ambit, and it also carried out economic activities, making it an enterprise. The cases of AICF and ABFI give us a situation wherein a regulator’s pervasive powers itself may lead to dominance. Both regulators used their powers to sabotage other organizations by not recognizing them or by excluding them, which was the abusive conduct. Being a standard setter does not preclude the existence of a market. Rather, the regulators have possibly prevented the formation of a contestable market. The High Court’s conclusion that ICAI lacks substitutable services in its seminars/workshops could be seen as a manifestation of dominance due to its regulatory powers of setting standards leading to absence of competition. This raises valid concerns about potential abuses of power by regulators, although further discussion is outside the scope of this piece.                                                                        Conclusion The aforementioned cases indicate that the key factor for all regulators is “economic activity,” which is distinguished from their regulatory functions. However, specifically for a statutory body/regulator, its regulatory functions are directly contrasted with its economic/commercial activities such that its functions as a regulator precludes it from performing economic or commercial activities, which by extension excludes them from the ambit of “enterprise”. The cases, when contrasted with the ICAI decision, present to us a situation wherein a regulatory authority carrying out economic activity, being an enterprise, can still be excluded from the purview of the CCI. As evidenced by the lines “this Court is unable to accept that the said powers extend to reviewing all decisions made by statutory bodies or a foreign government, which are not relatable to a sovereign function of the Government”. The case propounds that certain regulatory actions cannot be subjected to CCI’s scrutiny from the outset. Therefore, we now have a novel exclusion from the CCI’s scrutiny wherein one can be excluded as a regulator even if they are an enterprise. The author believes that the same may require clarification in future decisions. – Shourya Mitra Auditor Competition Law Regulation"

            "Put Options: Putting Up with Foreign Exchange Regulation By GuestJune 25, 202313 Min readAdd comment   [Ryan Joseph is a 3rd year B.B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) student at Jindal Global Law School] A decision of the Madras High Court in January this year in GPE (India) Limited v. Twarit Consultancy has added to the controversial debate over the enforcement of put options that guarantee assured returns. The High Court toed the line with other courts and upheld an arbitral award, notwithstanding the contention of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that such awards violate rules promulgated under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA). This post will analyse the prohibition on put options guaranteeing assured returns under the FEMA (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019 and the exceptions that various judgments have carved out. The post will then highlight the inefficiencies in such indirect enforcement to establish that enforcement of put options with guaranteed return constructs will never be commercially viable without regulatory support.   Prohibition on Put Options with an IRR Construct A put option is an agreement that creates a right in favour of the holder of a security to sell the security at a particular price at a particular time. This is a commonly used exit mechanism in private equity (PE) and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals. Investors often ask for the put option to have an internal rate of return (IRR) construct. IRR is a pricing mechanism that enables investors to determine the exit price they would require to achieve a particular return on their investment. When incorporating such constructs, the put option would read, “the acquirer shall have a right to sell the securities at a price equal to the Investors Capital plus a post-tax IRR of 19%”. Such clauses are drafted to hedge investment risks by guaranteeing an exit price that the investor could expect in case all other exit modes turn out inefficacious. Notwithstanding their commercial utility, their incorporation in agreements leads to legal complications as India’s foreign investment regulations prohibit such agreements. Rules 9(5) and 21(2)(c)(iii) of FEMA (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019 govern the pricing mechanism of equity shares transferred to a person resident in India from a person resident outside India. It states that the exit price provided to investors cannot exceed the valuation carried out according to any internationally accepted pricing methodology for valuation on an arm’s length basis certified by a chartered accountant. This value is called the fair market value (FMV). The explanation to the rule adds that a person resident outside India cannot be guaranteed an “assured exit price” when investing in the company. This rule poses difficulties for enforcing put options with an IRR construct as that guarantees the investor an assured exit price. Quite often, such pre-determined value exceeds the FMV at the time of exit. Regulatory Motive The regulatory motivation for prohibiting such constructs is that they tend to blur the difference between debt and equity. The single most differentiating marker of equity from debt is equity risk. Unlike a debt, where the risk is low because the creditor is legally owed the dues, the returns on debt transactions (the interest rate) are also low. Considering the high risks of an equity transaction, where the investor has no right over a return on its investment, the returns account for such risks and are far higher than those in a debt transaction. However, the IRR constructs allow parties to agree to a pre-determined exit value which assuages equity risks causing the regulator to view such transactions as debt dressed as equity. From a regulatory perspective, huge ramifications flow from the morphing of foreign investment into foreign debt. Foreign investments are positive infusions of capital into the domestic economy that can spur aggregate demand and widen the cyclical flow of money. Foreign debt, on the other hand, makes the domestic economy vulnerable. If Indians were to increase their external borrowing, the dollar’s value would rise, putting downward pressure on the value of the rupee, which would make the repayment of the debt in dollar more difficult as one needs more rupees to repay every dollar. If one were to borrow more to finance repayment, it would once again put a downward pressure on the rupee leading to a cycle of doom. Therefore, the RBI is extremely cautious with foreign debt and regulates it far more stringently than it regulates foreign investment. Commercial Interest Corporate India and foreign investors, on the other hand, have very strong reasons that justify the need for put options in investment agreements. Investors take a considerable amount of risk when investing in international markets that they are not familiar with. The geographical distance, regulatory differences and variations in language, culture, and the way of life act in conjunction with each other to severely increase the risk of investing in India. These risks are further accentuated when investing in startups. Managing these risks inflates the monitoring costs for foreign investors and swells the cost of investment in India leading to lower returns from their investments. Although other exit routes, such as going for an initial public offering (IPO), are available to foreign investors and, more often than not, these routes are preferred over exercising put options, there is no guarantee that such exit options will always be commercially viable. For instance, an investor who targeted to exit during the market downturn caused by Covid-19 might have found it very difficult to use the IPO route owing to the lacklustre performance of capital markets. Similarly, companies must navigate a complex regulatory pathway before going for an IPO. Put options with an IRR construct play an instrumental role in such circumstances as they assure the foreign investor of a basic return on their investment, notwithstanding market conditions. The tussle between regulatory and commercial interests has made the enforcement of put options a very sensitive area for Indian corporates. Owing to their commercial necessity, notwithstanding the prohibitions placed by the RBI, commercial workarounds have been found to enforce such clauses. Downside Protection  In the case of NTT Docomo, Inc. v. Tata Sons Ltd, the shareholders’ agreement (SHA) contained a clause stating that Tata Sons would either find a buyer for NTT Docomo’s shares at a predetermined price (“sale price”) or buy the shares back themselves. Unable to find buyers, Tata had to repurchase the shares. However, the FEMA rules allowed Docomo to receive only the “fair market value of their equity, which was lower than the sale price. Tata sought RBI’s permission to pay Docomo the sale price, but the permission was denied. The dispute went to arbitration, resulting in an award of $1.7 billion for Docomo. The RBI challenged the award’s enforceability, claiming a violation of FEMA rules. The Delhi High Court, while upholding the arbitral award, ruled that the mere fact that the SHA had a clause that mandated Tata to offer Docomo an exit at the sale price cannot by itself be a ground to conclude that the clause violates FEMA Rules. The SHA provided numerous other modes of exit, and Tata could have used any of those. However, upon failing to have done so, Tata was forced to use a particular mode of exit. Furthermore, Docomo’s total investment was $2.5 billion, of which the sale price was a mere $1.7 billion, half the investment value. Such a construct does not grant Docomo an “ascertained return” but acts as a downside protection construct wherein Docomo’s investment value is protected from dipping below a certain value. Repayment of Dues as Damages In the case before the Madras High Court in GPE (India), the investors in Haldia Coke and Chemicals Private Limited had a put option that required the promoters of Haldia Coke to purchase or cause the purchase of the shares held by the investors at an IRR of 24% of the amount invested. The promoters sought to resile from the obligation by relying on rule 21 of the FEMA (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019. However, a tribunal of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) found in favour of the investors and passed an award requiring the performance of the put option. During the enforcement proceedings before the Madras High Court the promoters challenged the enforcement on the grounds that the award violates the public policy of India as the put option provides for an exit at a guaranteed price which is proscribed by rule 21. Relying on Vijay Karia v. Prysmian Cavi, the Madras High Court ruled that a rectifiable violation of FEMA does not tantamount a violation of the public policy of India. Further, the Court went on to agree with the arbitral award and ruled that even if the put option in the share subscription and shareholders agreement is void, the promoters who while executing the contract represented that the covenants are in conformity with Indian law are liable to compensate the investor through damage equivalent to the entire unpaid sale consideration and that the investors may then remit the sum subject to the approval of RBI. The Delhi High Court in Shakti Nath v. Alpha Tiger upheld an arbitral award on the grounds that the investors did not seek to exercise the put option, rather they were claiming damages under section 73 of the Indian Contract Act. Although the defendants argued that seeking damages amounts to violating the RBI’s prohibition on put options, the Court found that unlike the exercise of a put option, a claim for damages does not violate any RBI regulations, and thus disagreed with the contention. Provision for Damages in the Articles of Association  When Merrill Lynch invested in Om Logistics, a clause was inserted in the articles of Om Logistics that created a put option in favour of Merrill Lynch whereby the promoters could be required to purchase the allotted securities from Merrill Lynch at a valuation that accounted for an IRR of 25% over the invested amount. In case the strike price exceeds the FMV, the promoters would have to pay the difference over the FMV as liquidated damages. Enforcement of the Put Option with RBI Approval In Banyan Tree Growth Cap. v. Axiom Cordages, the Bombay High Court dealt with a matter where the parties had a put option that guaranteed Banyan Tree a guaranteed return of 15% on its investment and upheld the enforceability of such a clause on two grounds. First, that the impugned clause is not inherently violative of FEMA rules. In a put option, the promise to sell shares at a predetermined price activates only when the investor accepts the investee’s put option. Therefore, until the moment such an offer is made, FEMA Rules have no implications for put options with IRR constructs. Further, the put option was only one amongst numerous other exit routes. Second, even when the put option is exercised, the investor not residing in India can still repatriate monies to the extent of the put options compliance with FEMA rules and, based on the Supreme Court’s ruling in IDBI Trusteeship v. Hubtown, any excess amounts can be kept in a nominee account of the investor in India and the same can be repatriated with RBI’s approval. The Delhi High Court’s decision in Cruz City 1 Mauritius Holdings v. Unitech Limited established a test on when a put option with an IRR construct can be said to provide a pre-determined price. The construct of the put option in Cruz City was the same as clauses in all other cases; however, its enforcement was made contingent to various other factors. The High Court observed that the option could be exercised only within a specified time and only if the construction was not commenced within the prescribed time. Therefore, it was not an open-ended assured exit option. Based on these findings, the Court enforced the put option but subjected the remittance to RBI approval. Limitations of Commercial Workarounds All the judgments named above were widely celebrated and viewed as judgments that crystalise India’s pro-business stance. Regardless, a closer look at the implications of these exceptions indicate that they do not truly help investors exercise their put options. At the outset, a put option can be freely exercised only when the strike price equals or is below the FMV. When the two prices match, it indicates that the company is performing extremely well. It is unlikely that an investor would exercise the put option in such circumstances and would use the IPO route for a better exit. Put options are more of a last resort solution that are useful when no other remedy exists. Their use is envisaged in circumstances when the FMV is far below the strike price; yet due to the regulations they cannot be exercised at that price which compromises their utility. In the NTT Docomo case, since the strike price was 50% less than the actual invested amount, the courts treated the put option as a downside protection. As there are not any more cases that dealt with “downside protection”, the propensity of courts to view put options from this lens is yet to be tested. Structuring exits by claiming the value through damages in arbitration is a very expensive and time-consuming strategy. The costs of arbitration and overall legal costs amounted for NTT Docomo as cited in the judgment stood at 120,000 GBP and 1,000,000,000 Japanese Yen respectively. When other costs such as pre and post dispute negotiation, enforcement measures, inter alia, the costs will increase considerably. Prima facie the outcomes from GPE (India) or Shakti Nath allow the investor to exit at the desired valuation, the requirement to park value over the FMV greatly hurts the autonomy of the investor. An India-focused fund may not object to the restriction as they can redeploy the funds in India. A joint venture partner or a strategic investor may find the restriction cumbersome as they need to find a new use for the surplus money in India. Moreover, practically it has been noticed that RBI very rarely gives the permission to remit excess sums offshore. In NTT Docomo, the RBI was willing to permit the remittance long before the litigation began. However, the Central Government, which is the final decision-making authority, rejected the RBI’s recommendation to grant an exception.   It is unlikely that the tussle between the commercial interests and regulatory concerns is going to be resolved anytime soon. This is unfortunate considering that without regulatory support, no matter how much space courts carveout to enforce put options, it will always be commercially inefficient. Therefore, it is of vital importance that a resolution between the two interests is found sooner than later. – Ryan Joseph Arbitration Foreign Exchange Regulation Foreign Investment Options in Securities RBI"

            "Reimagining the Insolvency Process: A Case of Multiple Resolution Plans By GuestJune 23, 20237 Min read1 comment   [Piyush Kr. Choubey and Kaustubh Kumar are 4th year students at the National University of Study and Research in Law, Ranchi] The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) in January 2023 floated a discussion paper on possible changes to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (the “Code”). One of the topics in the discussion paper was “Reimagining the consideration of the resolution plan and the manner of distribution of the proceeds from the same during the CIRP”, wherein, it proposed that more than one resolution plan could be accepted for the same corporate debtor (“CD”). However, at least one of the plans should provide for insolvency resolution of the CD as a going concern. Through this change the MCA seeks to maximise the value of the assets of the CD and avoid liquidation. In light of the aforementioned scenario, this post explores the said proposal considering the current provisions of the Code, which only permit one resolution plan for the CD, and the intent of legislature when it consolidated the laws regarding insolvency, bankruptcy and restructuring into one single code. It further discusses the potential benefits and challenges of this proposal for the creditors and stakeholders of the CD. Lastly, it concludes by providing some remedial measures that could be undertaken for the smooth implementation of the said proposal. Amendment to the CIRP Regulations The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (“IBBI”) brought an amendment to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations 2016 (“CIRP Regulations”) on 16 September 2022. The CIRP Regulations were amended to include regulation 36B(6A) as well as regulation 37(m), wherein the resolution professional may seek the committee of creditor’s (“CoC”) approval to invite resolution plans for the sale of one or all of the CD’s assets, if no resolution plan is submitted in response to her request. The MCA discussion paper on amending the Code is but a confirmation to this mechanism of multiple resolution plans for sale of CD’s assets. However, the same also clarifies that there must be at least one resolution plan for insolvency resolution of the CD as a going concern in order to invoke this mechanism. Now, before analysing the intricacies of this mechanism we need to understand the legislative intent behind it. Legislative Intent of Value Maximisation The Code was introduced for a smooth resolution of the assets of the CD as a going concern as well as maximising the value of CD’s assets. The same has been reiterated in plethora of its judgements by the Supreme Court. The current provisions of the Code are more than enough to fulfil these aforementioned objectives; however, there are situations where the assets of the CD are in different locations and consist of both functional and non-functional assets. In this situation, the prospective resolution applicant (“PRA”) might only be interested in the functional assets at some location as it would be too expensive for the PRA to revive the assets of the CD as whole. Another situation that could arise is when no resolution plan is received by the RP; herein, the assets of the CD go into liquidation. In both these scenarios, the primary objective of the Code, i.e., maximising the value of assets breaks down. Hence, the idea of multiple resolution plan or sale of one or more assets of a CD was conceptualised with the sole intent to maximise the value of CD’s assets. The Challenges Ahead and the Way Forward Although this appears simple to incorporate, there exist various challenges which should be addressed properly before implementing the proposed mechanism. Otherwise, they may hinder its implementation. Approval of the Committee of Creditors The Code requires the resolution plans to be approved by the CoC which is comprised of all the financial creditors (“FC”) of the CD whose claims have been verified by the interim resolution professional (“IRP”). Further, section 30(4) of the Code provides that CoC can approve a resolution plan by voting 66% of the voting shares of the FC in favour of it. However, in a scenario where the resolution plan is for an individual asset of the CD, wherein only one FC has the valid claim, the problem would arise as to whose voting share will be considered since the sole stakeholder of that particular asset will be the FC who have a claim in that asset. The same is nowhere clarified in both the amendment to the CIRP Regulations as well as the MCA discussion paper. Therefore, the authors believe that the first and foremost step should be to clarify the position of voting shares while voting for an individual resolution plan. The optimal solution to this would be to allow only the stakeholder of a particular asset to vote on the resolution plan considering they would be the most interested in such assets of CD. Fate of Other Assets vis-à-vis CIRP Regulations The amendment to CIRP Regulations provides that individual assets of the CD may be resolved in one resolution plan. However, the fate of other assets is left to be decided in any manner. Regulation 37(m) of the amended CIRP Regulations provides: “A resolution plan is required to provide for measures, as may be necessary, for insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor for maximization of value of its assets, including but not limited to, the sale of one or more assets of corporate debtor to one or more successful resolution applicants submitting resolution plans for such assets and manner of dealing with remaining assets.” [emphasis added] Herein, the term “manner” was vague in the sense that the resolution plan of any individual asset would not prescribe any manner of dealing with other assets. This was clarified by the MCA discussion paper that at least one of the plans must provide for insolvency resolution of the CD as a going concern. Partial Liquidation as the First Resort  It is reasonable to presume that after the proposed amendment, there could be a situation where PRAs submit resolution plans for only certain assets from which they are likely to gain profits. This will lead other remaining assets to liquidation. The liberty likely to be given to the PRAs through the said amendment to submit resolution plan for certain assets shall undermine the objectives of the Code. It is pertinent to note that the objective of the Code since its inception was to provide for ‘resolution’; not liquidation. The very foundational objective of the Code nowhere uses the word ‘liquidation’. Moreover, if this regime brought into effect without pondering over this point, it would be catastrophic to the expectations of the CD as the National Company Law Tribunal already has limited powers with respect to the approval of resolution plans and most of the resolution plans will be passed merely in the name of ‘commercial wisdom’ of the CoC. The authors’ views are that this ought to be clarified by the Ministry or Parliament beforehand rather than being tested before the courts so as to save time and cost. Conclusion  The MCA discussion paper along with the amended CIRP Regulations provide for approval of resolution plan for individual or more assets of the CD. The legislative intent behind this proposal is value maximisation and avoiding the CD’s assets undergo liquidation, which seems the best way to deal with value depreciation and liquidation. However, there are certain challenges which needs to be addressed before its implementation. Although a key obstacle concerning the fate of other assets was clarified by virtue of the MCA discussion paper, there is still one major problem to be addressed and that is the clarification regarding voting share required for approving a resolution plan related to a particular asset. Overall, this proposal is certainly a major step towards achieving the objective of value maximisation of the CD’s assets. However, it can only truly fulfil its intended purpose once it overcomes the aforementioned challenges. – Piyush Kr. Choubey & Kaustubh Kumar Debt Restructuring Insolvency"

            "Securing Borrowers, Shielding Lenders: RBI’s Default Loss Guarantee Regulations By GuestJune 23, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [RS Sanjanaa is a 3rd year BA LLB (Hons.) student at Symbiosis Law School, Pune] The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has granted approval to and released guidelines (on June 8, 2023) on the much-contended topic of default loss guarantee (DLG). A DLG model according to this refers to the default loss cover provided to a bank or non-banking finance company (NBFC) by the fintech company that was the originator of the loan, for a default on the loan. This announcement was made in the second bi-monthly monetary policy outcomes. According to clause 6 of these guidelines, the fintech companies (lending service providers) can partner with banks and non-banking financial companies (regulated entities) to provide up to 5% guarantee cover for the defaults across all bank/NBFC-fintech deals undertaken. This comes as a relief for the companies who were seeking clarity on the pre-existing DLG norms in the digital lending ecosystem and the outsourcing industry. This post highlights the pre-existing issues and considerations of the RBI prior to these guidelines. It then explains the guidelines in brief in addition to analyzing the implications it could have on the industry. The post concludes that this move by the RBI is much-needed, but the issues apparent in the guidelines need to be clarified at the earliest. Crafting the Guidelines Prior to these 2023 guidelines, the RBI had concerns regarding DLG agreements as it predicted a systematic risk if it were allowed. For instance, it could encourage lenders to take up undue risk through the assurance of receiving the guarantee in case of default. Even in the 2022 September guidelines on digital lending by the RBI, there was no clarity on the DLG structure. However, as mentioned in the report of the 2021 working committee of RBI, though fintech entities have been engaging in financial lending activities on both a stand-alone basis and through partnerships, they have operated in a regulatory gray area by not satisfying the “principal business” criteria to be subjected to the RBI regulations on lending. Popularly known as the 50-50 test, this entails that to be registered with the RBI as a NBFC and be regulated by it, the financial lending activity must be the principal business of the entity, provided that:  the financial assets gained through the lending activity must amount to at least 50% of the total assets; and, the income from the process must amount to at least 50% of the total income of the entity.  Now, at a time when the aforementioned regulated entities are becoming increasingly reliant on fintech companies, this lack of regulation paved way for massive financial vulnerability. Guidelines in Brief The guidelines came into effect on June 8, 2023, and they solely apply to digital lending. Default loss guarantee has been defined under clause 2.1 to also include implicit guarantee. Implicit guarantee refers to those contractual arrangements that are not explicitly structured as a guarantee, but the resulting economic impact resembles a guarantee. Any other means of guarantee agreements would classify as synthetic securitization or can attract provisions on loan participation. Eligibility For a fintech company to classify as a lending service provider, it needs to be a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013 as per clause 3 of the guidelines. A lending service provider pursuant to clause 2.5 of the 2022 guidelines refers to an agent of a regulated entity who undertakes functions of the latter such as customer acquisition.   Structure In terms of clause 4, a DLG agreement must have an explicit contract between the regulated entity and the lending service provider. It should include details such as the extent of the cover, the form of maintenance of the cover pursuant to clause 5, timeline for invocation and disclosure requirements pursuant to clause 11. The lending service provider shall have to showcase on their website, the number of loan portfolios and the respective amount of cover offered on the assured portfolios. The tenor of this contract shall at least for the longest period of the loan in the underlying loan portfolio pursuant to clause 10. According to clause 9, the DLG agreement must be invoked within 120 days of the default by the regulated entity. Exceptions The guidelines under clause 14 enlist two circumstances where the guarantee agreements will not fall under the ambit of DLG. One, all guarantee schemes of “Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises, Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing, and individual schemes under National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd.” Two, credit guarantee provided by Bank of International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, and any other multilateral development banks as per clause 5.5 of the RBI master circular issued on May 12, 2023. Anticipating the Beneficial Effects on Industry While the effects of the regulations on the industry are yet to be determined accurately, this has been welcomed by all entities, as it comes as a relief in the wake of last year’s disruptive guidelines on digital lending. The regulations offer a source of confidence for investors. They provides investors with the required assurance and mitigate the risk to participate in digital lending. In addition, traditional lending systems are downgrading in India due to reasons such as demonetization, advent of Unified Payment Interface and the lingering post-COVID experience. In such a light, the regulation of the digital lending ecosystem assists in promoting the same by assuring more customers, and more capital to customers by encouraging partnerships between regulated entities and lending service providers. The U.K. based company “Zopa” for instance, saw a 197% increase in 2013 in the number of lenders using its website in the first quarter, as opposed to the first quarter of 2012 after bringing forth a similar system. This ultimately also leads to a massive economic boost. Furthermore, with the aforementioned disclosure requirements, any new regulated entity has the ability to assess the deal-worthiness of the lending service provider prior to entering into a contract. Deficiencies and Loopholes in Digital Lending Agreement Guidelines The regulations have the potential to cause a moral hazard by aiding the regulated entities to undertake undue risks with such guarantees by the lending service providers. But this moral hazard also extends to the borrowers as they could become lax knowing that a portion of their loans will be covered. This could also mean that the regulations could attract borrowers who are more prone to defaulting, affecting the quality of the loan portfolio. Furthermore, there would arise a need for restructuring the existing loan mechanism in order to increase the funds for guaranteeing the defaults. This implies an increase in interest rates. In contrast, prior to this regulation, lending service providers were offering as high as 100% guarantee, with an average of 25-30%. Five percent thus imposes a substantially lesser amount of guarantee. This could deter investors. This dichotomy imposes a dangerously unpredictable situation for the digital lending ecosystem. Moreover, the performance-led payout models that were previously in execution would, in all possibility, continue to exist. By this, the regulated entities would carry the potential to receive beyond the 5% cap. The RBI will not have the power to control the commission-led model as the regulator cannot mandate commission rates. Apart from the issues with the potential impact of the guidelines, there exist certain inherent loopholes in the guidelines. While the RBI has specific 5% as the cap, 5% of what has not been clarified. Though it states that it will be 5% of the books, there are several interpretations of this. Claimants could state one amount that they want to achieve on the books, but in actuality have a lesser amount. And there would be penalization as loan portfolios are dynamic due to several risk factors. Furthermore, even if it is to be maintained at 5%, it becomes difficult to keep track of and ensure that the limit is maintained. The onus to keep track of the same, has also not been clarified. The other major implication of this 5% threshold is that, most of the fintech companies such as Simpl, Moneytap, Lazypay, Uni and Zestmoney, have been bringing in new segments of the population into the credit system. And this threshold would possibly limit the lenders from providing loans to anyone without a good Cibil score, thereby also reducing partnerships. Coupled with the existing PPI and LRS norms, this could also lead to institutions shutting down their lending services. Conclusion and Recommendations While the issues pertaining to the regulations are crucial, they do not undermine the necessity for such regulation. Institutionalizing DLG was envisioned by the Boston Consulting Group in 2021 itself, as the action agenda for governments and regulators. By maintaining the right balance between innovation and consumer protection, properly regulated DLG agreements can facilitate orderly development of the digital lending ecosystem and enhance credit penetration in the economy, as envisioned by the RBI Governor. In furtherance of this, the regulations firstly need to accommodate a higher cap amount. Based on previous base rates of lending by fintech companies outside of housing and personal loans, this should at least be 10%. Provisions on compliance monitoring also need to be provided to ensure lesser burden for the regulated entities. The disclosure requirements mentioned must also be enhanced to include information such as history of defaults and the success or failure of the related guarantee transactions. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the interest rates or other charges are not unfairly increased citing DLG norms, any changes must be scrutinized by the RBI and the process must be transparent. This should come with a breakdown of costs. – RS Sanjanaa Banking Information Technology RBI"

            "SEBI’s Reforms for REITs/InvITs: Assessing the Broader Corporate Governance Concerns By GuestJune 21, 20237 Min readAdd comment   [Nikhil Javali is a 4th year B.B.A. LL.B. student at National Law University Odisha] As real estate investment trusts (‘REITs’) and infrastructure investment trusts (‘InvITs’) gain global recognition as a powerful investment vehicle, India is taking significant strides towards aligning its REIT/InvIT regulations with global best practices. Across the world, REITs have emerged as a dominant fundraising vehicle for income-generating assets. Originating in the United States in 1960, REITs/InvITs now command a total market capitalization of US$2.4 trillion. In India, however, this investment vehicle is still in its nascent stages, with the first listed REIT in India making an entry only in 2019. Since then, the market has grown exponentially. During the fiscal year 2021-22, India witnessed a significant milestone as it achieved the highest-ever total inflows of foreign direct investment (‘FDI’), amounting to $84.8 billion. This record-breaking figure reflects the growing confidence of international investors in the Indian market and its potential for investment opportunities. In line with this objective of streamlining the REIT/InvIT landscape in line with international practices, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’), in its consultation paper dated May 16 2023, proposed that unitholders of an REIT/InvIT be given certain special rights. The recent changes proposed by SEBI seeks to put India on par with the global markets. Moreover, SEBI’s reforms are expected to attract greater investor confidence. This will also aid in aligning India’s position as a robust and attractive investment destination, encouraging more participation from institutional and retail investors alike. In this post, I will delve deeper into the specific changes proposed by SEBI and examine their implications for REITs/InvITs in India. I will also explore the broader corporate governance concerns that may arise due to these proposed changes and point out how this might hamper the overall objective of placing the REIT/InvIT market on the global stage. Changes Proposed by SEBI: A Boon or a Trojan Horse? Currently, the SEBI (Real Estate Investment Trusts) Regulations 2014 (‘SEBI (REIT) Regulations’) provide in regulation 4(2)(g) that no unitholder can enjoy superior voting rights or any other rights over another unitholder of the REIT. A similar provision also exists in the SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations 2014 (‘SEBI (InvIT) Regulations’). The consultation paper released by SEBI lays out two options for changing this framework by conferring nomination rights to unitholders. Option A The first option envisages nomination rights to unitholders holding a minimum of 10% units in the REIT/InvIT by giving them the right to appoint one director for every 10% units held on the board of the Investment Manager/Manager (‘IM’) of the REIT/InvIT. This has been coupled with the proposal that unitholders who own lesser than 10% can join together, and a collective holding of 10% would give them nomination rights of one director on the board of the IM. It is also relevant to note that SEBI identifies a significant drawback of this option. The consultation paper points out that the regulatory requirements outlined in the SEBI REIT and InvIT Regulations prescribe that at least half of the directors on the Board of the IM must be independent. Accordingly, the new proposal seeks to grant the right to nominate a director to any unitholder holding 10% of the units (for every 10% held). This introduces the possibility of a considerably large board. In the extreme scenario where each unitholder exercises their right to nominate a director, and assuming each unitholder holds ten percent of the units, the board size could reach a maximum of 20 directors, with 10 being independent directors and 10 nominated directors. This could lead to the board becoming excessively large, prompting concerns regarding effective governance. Having a large board might create potential hindrances to effective communication and engagement among directors. It is important to consider that all stakeholders might not have the same interests; moreover, aligning their interests becomes even more difficult with a large board. There is also a risk of the board becoming ineffective and overly bureaucratic, ultimately resulting in delays in decision making. The real estate market is highly susceptible to changes in governments, policy changes, interest rate hikes, and the like. In such an atmosphere, effective decision making becomes the need of the hour. Option B The second option proposes that an IM be mandated to constitute a Unitholders’ Council (‘UC’) who would comprise of the nominees of the unitholders of the REIT/InvIT. This is similar to the current framework governing Alternative Investment Funds (‘AIFs’) and the constitution of an Investment Committee (‘IC’) that gives approval to the decisions of the AIF. The difference between the AIF framework and the current proposal for REITs/InvITs is that while constituting an IC is voluntary in nature, SEBI proposes a mandatory UC be formed under this option. Again, any unitholder holding a minimum of 10% units in the REIT/InvIT would be entitled to nominate one person to the UC. All decisions to be taken by the UC would be by simple majority. It is also proposed that this UC include a minimum of 3 members be present. Additionally, if the UC does not manage to reach a strength of 3 members, two things can be done:  The two members of the UC can appoint an independent director to the UC to meet the minimum strength of 3 members, or The UC can be given the right to nominate one director on to the board of the IM.  SEB’’s proposed framework for decision-making power in the context of REITs/InvITs involves a sequential process. In instances where the board of the IM holds decision-making authority, they will be the initial decision-making body for a given matter. Subsequently, upon approval of the matter by the board, it will be presented to the UC. In the event that the UC of the IM does not accept or approve a specific matter, it will be subjected to a voting process during a unitholders meeting. Furthermore, matters necessitating unitholder approval will encompass recommendations from both the board of the IM and the UC. Also, matters exclusively pertaining to the operational aspects of the IM, such as financials and employee compensation, will fall under the discretionary purview of the board. While SEBI’s efforts are definitely a step towards aligning the REIT/InvIT framework with global best practices, the changes proposed have certain flaws from a broader corporate governance perspective. Firstly, the sequential process of decision-making, starting with the board of directors of the IM and subsequently involving the UC, may result in a potential imbalance of power. This could lead to a concentration of decision-making authority in the hands of the IM’s board, potentially marginalizing the influence of unitholders in the decision-making process. Moreover, clarity regarding the exact nature of decisions that can be taken jointly by the IM’s board and UC is required. This has a direct impact on investor confidence – one of the core objectives of the consultation paper that still stands unfulfilled. Secondly, while the inclusion of recommendations from both the IM’s board and the UC is intended to give unitholders a say in the decision-making process, it may introduce complexities and conflicts. The diverse interests represented by these two could lead to discrepancies in their decision making, potentially impeding the effectiveness of the decision-making process. Conclusion SEBI’s initiatives to enhance participation of investors in REITs/InvITs are commendable. The proposed rights to unitholders demonstrate an attempt to involve key stakeholders and establish a structured process. However, to ensure robust corporate governance practices within the REIT/InvIT sector, it is imperative to address the broader concerns by striking a balance between stakeholder participation, decision-making authority, and accountability mechanisms. Only through careful consideration and refinement can the proposed framework align with global best practices and effectively safeguard the interests of REIT/InvIT unitholders. – Nikhil Javali Corporate Governance Financial Markets Real Estate SEBI"

            "Stricter Framework for Sale, Lease or Disposal of Undertaking by a Listed Entity By GuestJune 21, 202310 Min readAdd comment   [Nitu Poddar is a Partner at Vinod Kothari and Company, and can be reached at [email protected]] Disposal of an undertaking (whole or substantially the whole) can be carried out either as part of a scheme of arrangement or otherwise by way of slump sale or business transfer agreement (‘BTA’). Disposal, other than by way of scheme of arrangement, has so far been regulated according to section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’) which requires approval of the shareholders by way of special resolution. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’) has prescribed an approval requirement in this regard by way of introduction of regulation 37A by way of theSEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2023 (‘Amendment Regulations’) effective from June 14, 2023 that requires listed entities to follow a stricter regime for disposal of undertaking. This mandates an approval from a majority of the public shareholders who are not interested in the transaction, disclosure of the object of the transaction, commercial rationale and use of proceeds arising from such transaction. While there is an exemption provided in case of transactions with a wholly owned subsidiary (WOS), the approval regime will apply in case of disposal of undertaking by such WOS or any reduction in shareholding in the WOS subsequent to transfer of the undertaking. The said amendment is based on the Consultation Paper published by SEBI on February 21, 2023. Apart from incorporating the provisions proposed in this regard in the Consultation Paper, the amendment has introduced new provisions as well. The provision on seeking approval from the shareholders of the listed entity in case a WOS is used as a conduit for transfer in undertaking is a new requirement brought in through the amendment. Effective Date Regulation 37A came into force with immediate effect, i.e., from June 14, 2023.  The Amendment Regulations clarify that the new provision will not apply in cases where the notice for seeking shareholders’ approval has already been dispatched. Meaning of ‘Undertaking’ The meaning of the term ‘undertaking’ in regulation 37A is the same as that defined in section 180(1)(a) of the Act. The section refers to a numerical parameter of what should be considered as an undertaking. However, before testing the numerical parameter, one needs to assess whether the asset to be disposed of is at all an undertaking. For this, such asset should be capable of being identified as a unit, i.e., has assets and liabilities of its own discrete of the listed entity.  Once this qualitative criteria is met, undertaking shall be covered under section 180(1)(a) and regulation 37A if:  investment of the company in such undertaking is more than 20% of its net worth; or the undertaking generates at least 20% of the total income of the company.  Further, the expression “substantially the whole of the undertaking” means at least 20%  of the value of the undertaking. For a detailed understanding on the meaning of the term, please refer to this article. Approval From a Majority of Eligible Public Shareholders In addition to the special resolution required under section 180(1)(a) and regulation 37A for disposal of undertaking, in case such undertaking is that of a listed company, regulation 37A additionally requires approval from majority of public shareholders who are not in any way interested in the transaction. Votes of only such public shareholders shall be counted for the second criteria above, who are not a party, directly or indirectly, to such sale, lease or otherwise disposal of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the listed entity (‘eligible public shareholder’). Thus, the voting strength of the promoters of the company is disregarded for the purpose of achieving the majority of minority vote. This approval from the majority of the public shareholders is in addition to the approval through special resolution, where the promoters are entitled to vote. It is interesting to note that this approval criteria, while seems similar, is actually different from the one required for appointment of independent directors of a listed company under regulation 25(2A) of Listing  Regulations or under regulation 37 in case of a scheme of arrangement (‘SoA’).     Approval under reg 37A   Approval under reg 25(2A)   Approval under reg 37     Special resolution; and   Special resolution; or   Majority of members representing 3/4th in value [as per section 230]     Approval from majority of the eligible public shareholders   Ordinary resolution and approval from majority of the public shareholders   Approval from majority of the public shareholders     As discussed in the Consultation Paper, the idea of placing this additional criteria for approval is to prevent prejudice to the public shareholders in case of disposal of undertaking outside the scheme of arrangement. Disposal as a part of the SoA undergoes stringent scrutiny and approval regime including observation letter from stock exchange and approval from the National Company Law Tribunal (‘NCLT’). The requisite approval from shareholders also includes approval from the majority of shareholders in number representing 3/4th in value of the shares held by them. Transaction Additionally Classifying as a Material RPT  Practically, there could be a situation where an undertaking is disposed to a related party. A question would arise with respect to the manner of seeking prior approval from the shareholders in case of a material related party transaction (‘Material RPT’) in terms of the Listing Regulations or the Act. In this regard, it should be noted that:  Approval from shareholders for an RPT is required only in case where such RPT is material in terms of either the Act, 2013 or the Listing Regulations; If material, the approval requirement under RPT framework will be applicable which is considerably different from the approval framework for disposal of undertaking under section 180(1)(a) or reg. 37A.      Points of difference    Approval under reg 37A   Approval under reg 23         Resolution type   (i) Special resolution; and (ii) Approval from majority of the eligible public shareholders   Ordinary resolution           Who cannot vote   For the purpose of the second criteria of approval, public shareholders who have a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, cannot vote.   All related parties of the company cannot vote irrespective of whether such entity is a related party to the particular transaction or not.          Accordingly, two separate resolutions ought to be obtained from the shareholders for approval (i) for sale, lease or disposal of undertaking; and (ii) for approval of a Material RPT.  Information to be Disclosed to the Shareholders Section 180(4) of the Act requires the special resolution to include conditions regarding the use, disposal or investment of the sale proceeds arising from the disposal of undertakings. Regulation 37A additionally requires the following disclosure in the explanatory statement:  object of such disposal; commercial rationale of such disposal; use of proceeds arising therefrom.  In case of a Material RPT, the disclosures will be required to be made in terms of SEBI Circular dated November 22, 2021. Transfer of an Undertaking to a WOS Considering a WOS to be an extension of the holding company, the provision of 37A has exempted the approval regime for transfer of undertaking to the WOS. However, if such WOS further transfers the undertaking to any other entity, or the listed company intends to dilute its shareholding in the WOS, the approval regime under regulation 37A will be applicable. It may be noted that this is a new insertion and was not part of the Consultation Paper. It would be useful to examine a few scenarios here:     Scenarios    Applicability of reg 37A on the Listed Entity (‘LE’)       LE transfers an undertaking to WOS   Not applicable     LE transfers an undertaking to a 90% subsidiary   Applicable     LE transfers an undertaking to WOS which further transfers the same undertaking to another entity   Applicable     LE transfers an undertaking to WOS. The WOS transfers some other undertaking to another entity   Not applicable     LE has not transferred any undertaking to WOS. WOS intends to transfer its undertaking to another entity.   Not applicable       The WOS is itself a result of hive off (outside scheme) of an undertaking from the LE. It now intends to transfer its undertaking to another entity   Applicable. Considering the WOS itself in toto is a result of transfer of an undertaking by the LE, any further transfer by it ought to be covered by reg 37A.     LE has transferred an undertaking to the WOS pursuant to SoA. Now the WOS intends to transfer that undertaking to another entity   Not applicable     LE has transferred its undertaking to WOS. Now LE intends to dilute its shareholding in the WOS:   –       by transferring its shareholding in the WOS; –       by allowing the WOS to issue convertible securities to any other entity        Applicable     LE intends to dilute its shareholding in any other WOS   Not applicable. However, applicability of clause (5) and (6) of regulation 24 of Listing Regulations is to be checked individually for each case.     LE has transferred the undertaking to its WOS prior to the amendment, the WOS is further transferring such undertaking post this amendment   Applicable.   Keeping in mind the intent of the provision, if the WOS, to which an undertaking was transferred prior to the notification of the Amendment Regulations, intends to transfer such undertaking to any entity, the provisions of reg 37A should be made applicable and requisite approval from the shareholders of the LE is required to be obtained.     It should be noted that the above requirement is exclusive of the requirement under clauses (5) and (6) of regulation 24 and that under clause (4) of regulation 23 in case of Material RPT undertaken by the unlisted subsidiaries of the listed entity. The difference in the applicability of shareholders’ approval requirement is summarized hereunder:     Point of difference    Regulation 37A   Regulation 24(5)   Regulation 24(6)       Applicability   Using a WOS to transfer an undertaking outside scheme, to a third party   Disposal of shareholding / control in a material subsidiary such that it ceases to be a subsidiary   Selling, disposing and leasing of assets, outside scheme, amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year     Materiality of the subsidiary relevant?   No   Yes   Yes     Approval required by LE   (i) Special resolution; and (ii) Approval from majority of eligible public shareholders   Special resolution   Special resolution     Non-applicability of Regulation 37A It is quite common for companies to seek a parallel approval under section 180(1)(a) of the Act along with approval for borrowing limits under section 180(1)(c). The requirement of regulation 37A is exempted for disposal of undertakings arising out of any covenant under any agreement with financial institutions and debenture trustees, e.g., in case of security enforcement. Immediately Actionable for Listed Entities (‘LE’) Extension of the provision to WOS requires some background work to be done by the LE which has WOS(s). The LE needs to check back whether there has been any transfer of undertaking to the WOS or if the WOS is actually an outcome of spin off from the LE. Having done so, the LE and its WOS needs to be adequately sensitized with the amendments so that the LE can be alerted in case (i) the undertaking from the LE is proposed to be transferred to another entity; or (ii) the LE intends to dilute its shareholding in the WOS (even by 1%) where an undertaking has been transferred. – Nitu Poddar Companies Act Company Law Corporate Governance Mergers and Acquisitions SEBI"

        "title": "Private Equity Firms and the Liability Puzzle of their Subsidiaries",
        "read_on_content": [
            "Private Equity Firms and the Liability Puzzle of their Subsidiaries By GuestJune 20, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Rupam Dubey is a 2nd year B.A.LLB student and Hrithik Merchant a 4th year B.A.LLB student, both at the National Law School of India University Bangalore] The traditional essence of private equity was rooted in the strategy of acquiring companies for the purpose of selling them, while remaining detached from the day-to-day operations of the portfolio company. However, the landscape of modern private equity is constantly evolving and dynamic. Funds have acquired companies to benefit from synergies between their investee companies. The relationship between funds and their portfolio companies has become vital to address issues related to agency costs between the fund and the company, as well as between the fund and its investors. As a result, funds are increasingly becoming more involved in the companies they invest in. This increased involvement can be observed through various aspects, inter alia, including majority board representations, mandatory approval on affirmative voting matters, anti-dilution rights, and liquidation preferences. In March 2023, in Doris Anderson v County of Fresno, the US District Court of California extensively addressed the issue of private equity funds’ liability in portfolio investments. The Court ultimately ruled in favour of the funds and decided not to disregard the separation between the fund and its portfolio companies. While the decision relied heavily on the plaintiffs’ inability to sufficiently back up their claims, an important question arises: what is the responsibility of private equity funds given their increasing influence over various entities? Moreover, is there a definitive test or threshold to determine when liability can be attributed to the private equity fund? These questions would attain some relevance for India as well. This post delves into these questions by examining recent legal precedents and contemporary jurisprudence. Peeking Behind the Corporate Curtain: Unmasking the Corporate Veil in India’s Business Realm The current framework to impose liability on a parent company for tortious act of the subsidiary  through lifting the corporate veil to understand the interconnectedness of the transactions in companies has been a subject matter of judicial decisions and academic discussions. In the landmark ruling of State of Rajasthan v Gotan Lime Stone, the Indian Supreme Court summarised the jurisprudence on lifting the corporate veil. It was held that the doctrine is an exception to the distinct corporate personality. When public interest is involved, then the court can lift the veil to understand the substance of the corporate transaction and the objective it sought to achieve. Courts have clarified that lifting the corporate veil and discovering the improper conduct of a company would notinduce liability of the individual shareholders. In Meekin Transmission Ltd v State of Uttar Pradesh, the Allahabad Hight Court held that the liability of a company is not synonymous with the liability of the shareholders and the latter cannot be made liable under a decree against the company through piercing the corporate veil. This position was affirmed by the Calcutta High Court Pashcim Gujarat Vij v Manibhad 2019 SCC OnLine Guj 6933, where it noted that personal assets of shareholders cannot be attached as company’s assets. In a nutshell, being a separate legal entity, the jurisprudence on corporate veil in India protects the funds from the actions of the investee company. Corporate veils are rarely pierced, especially when the ownership of a company lies with a group of companies and not individual shareholders. Rhythm of Risk: Exploring Global Beats in Private Equity Fund Liability: Grooving Through the Challenges This situation is not unique to India but also jurisdictions around the world. In April 2022, a federal appeals court in the US was faced with this issue in a healthcare fraud dispute. The private equity firm HIG Capital and its subsidiary Surgery Partners Inc were accused in a whistleblower lawsuit of engaging in a scheme to overbill Medicare for unnecessary urine drug tests. The appeal filed against HIG Capital argued that it was involved in a distinct form of healthcare fraud driven by external capital. However, the appeal was dismissed due to similarities with a previous dispute. Notably, HIG Capital had previously settled whistleblower fraud claims involving another company it owned, South Bay Community Services, for $20 million. In another case, Pearson v Component Technology Corp, the Court imposed liability on a fund manager as upstream liability and laid down elements to determine it. Those elements included commonality of directors, de facto exercise of control, and unity of personal policies emanating from common sources and dependency of operations. The component of de facto exercise of control has been used in Re Jevic Holding Corp, where the Court imposed liability for illegal employment practices due to the fund manager’s exercise of substantial control over the subsidiary. This de factocontrol test was further expanded in Richards v Advanced Accessory Systems. Here, the Court held that de facto control does not mean ordinary stock ownership but involvement in business and organisational strategy financial and investment management and advisory services for the subsidiary. A similar legal position is also adopted in the European Union (EU). The courts use a heightened version of the de facto control test. For instance, in Imperial Chemical Industries v Commission, the European Court of Justice held that it is insufficient for the parent company to have the ability to exercise control over the group of companies, but it must be shown that the influence has impacted the decision-making ability so as to treat it as a single economic unit. Hence, it can be inferred that the court’s discretion to lift the corporate veil implies that the subsidiary’s decision-making should be influenced by the funds. This influence is necessary to hold them accountable for any wrongful actions committed by the subsidiary companies. Liability Remix: Unleashing the Legal Groove for Private Equity Funds in India The Indian market has undergone a shift from being primarily focused on minority investments by funds to a situationwhere these firms now engage in major buyout transactions and seek control. However, in the current era of corporatisation, the traditional presumption of separate and distinct identities, as established in Salomon v Salomon, does not adequately address the liability of funds. This is due to the legal fiction that allows multiple investors to operate as a single economic unit. It is entirely reasonable for funds to exert control in order to implement effective policies that fulfil their legal and financial obligations. The acquisition vehicles are used by funds to shield themselves from the obligations of these vehicles, which are ultimately the target of piercing the corporate veil. For instance, funds typically contribute only 20-40% of the acquisition price of shares in target companies while securing critical assets. The firm itself provides a relatively small amount of the funding capital but receives a significantly larger share of the returns. This form of extreme leverage, when combined with limited liability and corporate control, creates incentives to burden target companies with excessively high and unsustainable debt. This situation differs significantly from investing in an established large company. Firstly, when investing in that company, one typically needs to pay the full price for the stock, without the option of acquiring it at a discounted rate of 10 to 30 percent. Even if one purchases the stock on margin, a minimum of 50-70 percent of the share price, and often more, must be paid up front. Secondly, unlike private equity investments, buying that stock does not come with the additional conditions that exists in private equity transactions. Thirdly, the acquisition of that stock does not inherently involve that company taking on substantial debt themselves. Lastly, when investing in such giant companies, one may or may not have control over the company, which means they cannot exploit the company, deprive it of resources for research and development, or withhold reinvestment to cover the debt from a leveraged buyout, and so on. Therefore, the issue with private equity lies not solely in limited liability itself but in the combination of limited liability with other distinctive and inevitable aspects of private equity. Limited liability, when combined with extreme leverage, creates a significantly imbalanced risk/reward trade-off that incentivizes excessive risk-taking at the expense of good corporate governance. One can argue that the liability for the wrongful actions of subsidiaries should not be extended to funds. Instead, the responsibility should be placed on the directors and decision-makers of the subsidiary, that is, the individuals who manage affairs the company. Nonetheless, blanket protection cannot be granted to funds. It is necessary to differentiate between controlling directors and passive directors in this context. This differentiation should be determined on a case-specific basis. We subscribe to the knowledge (actual and constructive) approach. Here, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the fund had prior knowledge of the wrongful activity of the subsidiary and failed to take any action to prevent it. The burden of proof should be set at a higher level to avoid imposing unwarranted liability on funds for the actions of their subsidiary companies. The law should consider the distinctions and roles of the participants in subsidiaries. Knowledge here should be distinguished from actual participation or intention to commit the wrong. In order to hold a fund liable, the plaintiff must demonstrate the corporate distinctiveness of the entity and show that the fund exercised significant control over the decision-making processes of the board of directors. This is referred to as the “responsible corporate officer doctrine”, which holds controlling individuals or firms liable for corporate misconduct regardless of their actual participation. The knowledge of the wrongdoing is sufficient to establish liability in such cases. Therefore, the liability for corporate misconduct can be limited with regards to funds depending on the facts but cannot be extinguished completely in other circumstances. – Rupam Dubey & Hrithik Merchant Company Law Corporate Veil International Developments"

            "Analysis of SAT Order: Appointment of Independent Director Above 75 years By GuestJune 20, 202311 Min read1 comment   [Gaurav Pingle is a practising company secretary and can be reached at [email protected]] Considering the importance of independent directors on the boards of listed entities, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been amending the provisions relating to their appointment, re-appointment, appointment process, remuneration, and the like under the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 2015 (“SEBI Listing Regulations”). In April 2023, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (“SAT”) in Nectar Life Sciences Ltd v. SEBIinterpreted one such amendment under the SEBI Listing Regulations in relation  to the appointment of independent director above the age of 75 years. This post is an analysis of the said SAT order. Background of the Amendment to the SEBI Listing Regulations On June 2 2017, SEBI had constituted a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Uday Kotak (“Kotak Committee”) for improving the standards of corporate governance of listed companies in India. On October 5, 2017, Kotak Committee submitted its report to SEBI. The SEBI Board (in its meeting held on March 28, 2018) accepted several recommendations of the Kotak Committee without any modifications, whereas certain recommendations were accepted with modifications. The Kotak Committee had recommended that certain checks and balances should be considered in connection with the age of non-executive directors similar to the provisions of the Companies Act for executive directors in terms of section 196(3)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013. Pursuant thereto, on May 9, 2018, SEBI amended the SEBI Listing Regulations accepting the Committee’s recommendations in this regard, as mentioned below. Amendment to the SEBI Listing Regulations Regulation 17 of the Listing Regulations (relating to ‘board of directors’) was amended and clause (1A) was inserted as follows: “No listed entity shall appoint a person or continue the directorship of any person as a non-executive director who has attained the age of seventy five years unless a special resolution is passed to that effect, in which case the explanatory statement annexed to the notice for such motion shall indicate the justification for appointing such a person.” It is important to note here that the said provision is applicable to non-executive directors and not just independent directors. The said provision is also applicable to non-executive directors from the promoters group. Recent SAT Order in Nectar Life Sciences Ltd. v. SEBI In this case, regulation 17(1A) of the SEBI Listing Regulations was interpreted by the SAT. Due to the death of a non-executive independent director, a casual vacancy was created and was subsequently filled up by an appointment of another independent director under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the SEBI Listing Regulations. The age of such newly-appointed independent director was 75 years and 9 months. The appointment was approved by the board of directors based on the recommendation of Nomination and Remuneration Committee. However, before the approval of the shareholders of the listed entity could be obtained, the appointed independent director resigned. Observing that the shareholders’ approval was not obtained by the listed entity, the National Stock Exchange (“NSE”) issued a notice regarding the non-compliance with regulation 17(1A) of the Listing Regulations and accordingly imposed a fine. The listed entity made an application for waiver of the fine, which was rejected by the NSE. The NSE had observed that prior approval of the shareholders was required under regulation 17(1A) of the Listing Regulations and passing of special resolution by the shareholders of the company was a “qualificatory condition”, and therefore an essential condition for appointment of director under regulation 17(1A) of SEBI Listing Regulations. For the purpose of appointing a director or filling up the casual vacancy of director, the SAT has referred to sections 149, 152(2), 161(4) of the Companies Act, 2013 and regulations 17(1A), 17(1C), 25 of the SEBI Listing Regulations and has observed as follows:  There is no provision in SEBI Listing Regulations for filling up a casual vacancy of a director in a company and the casual vacancy can only be filled up under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the rules made thereunder; Regulation 17(1A) of the SEBI Listing Regulations is not applicable for purpose of filling up a casual vacancy under the Companies Act, 2013; According to Regulation 17(1C) of the SEBI Listing Regulations, the appointment of a director made by the board of directors is required to be approved by the shareholders/members of the company in the next general meeting or within three months from the date of appointment, whichever is earlier; Regulation 17(1A) of the SEBI Listing Regulations shall be read with section 152(5) of the Companies Act and not in isolation; By applying the principles of interpretation of statutes, the SAT observed that “Section 17(1A) should be read harmoniously with the provisions of Sections 152, 161(4) of the Companies Act read with Rule 4 of the Rules and Regulation 17(1C) of the LODR Regulations which makes it clear that even if a person above the age of 75 years is appointed by the Board of Directors to fill up a casual vacancy, such appointment is required to be approved subsequently within the prescribed period by a special resolution in the next general meeting by the members of the Company.” On further explaining regulation 17(1A) of the Listing Regulations which states that “No listed entity shall appoint a person or continue the directorship of any person as a non-executive director who has attained the age of seventy five years unless a special resolution is passed to that effect…”, the SAT observed that “The word ‘unless’ depicted in Regulation 17(1A) does not mean “prior approval” nor the requirement of passing a special resolution is a qualificatory condition for appointment of a person as a Director.”  Analysis of SAT Order The issue framed by the SAT – “whether prior approval is required to be taken from the shareholders of the Company through a special resolution before a person who has attained the age of 75 years can be appointed to fill up a casual vacancy” – has no reference to either non-executive directors or independent directors or regulation 17(1A) of the SEBI Listing Regulations. It seems that the SAT has considered regulation 17(1A) of the SEBI Listing Regulations for appointment of any director of the company and not for only non-executive directors of the company. The SAT has placed greater emphasis on ‘filling up of a casual vacancy’ than on the procedure for appointment of non-executive director under regulation 17(1A) of the SEBI Listing Regulations. Further, the SAT’s reference to section 161 of the Companies Act, 2013 which relates to the ‘Appointment of Additional Director, Alternate Director and Nominee Director’ also seems misplaced as the section talks about the modes of appointment of directors by the board of directors of the company along with a requirement of articles of association of the company. Section 161 of the Act states that subject to the provisions in the articles of association, the board of directors of the company can make appointments of additional director, alternate director, nominee director and director by casual vacancy, which appointments can be made for an executive director or non-executive director (independent director or not). There is no reference made to section 196(3)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 in the SAT order, which provides that – “No company shall appoint or continue the employment of any person as managing director, whole-time director or manager who — (a) is below the age of twenty-one years or has attained the age of seventy years: Provided that appointment of a person who has attained the age of seventy years may be made by passing a special resolution in which case the explanatory statement annexed to the notice for such motion shall indicate the justification for appointing such person; Provided further that …….” The aforesaid provision is applicable to all companies. The wordings of section 196(3)(a) of the Act are similar to that of regulation 17(1A) of the SEBI Listing Regulations, except for the points that section 196(3)(a) of the Act talks about the upper age limit of managing director, whole time directors as 70 years while regulation 17(1A) of the Listing Regulations refers to the upper age limit of 75 years for non-executive directors in listed companies. The Division Bench of Bombay High Court, in Sridhar Sundararajan v. Ultramarine & Pigments Ltd. & Rangaswamy Sampath, while interpreting the section 196(3)(a) of Companies Act, 2013, ruled: “The language of section 196(3)(a) of the Act is plain, simple and unambiguous and it applies to all the Managing Directors who have attained the age of 70 years and the Section does not make any distinction between the Managing Directors who have been appointed before 01/04/2014 and those after 01/04/2014. The moment Managing Director attains the age of 70 years, disqualification mentioned in Section 196(3)(a) of the Act would operate immediately”. The Bombay High Court further observed that such disqualification would operate not only at the stage of appointment but also would operate in the case of a person who has already been appointed and attained the age of 70 years and such a person, therefore, by virtue of disqualification, had no right to be continued as managing director, unless a special resolution was passed by the company. Applying the said principle to regulation 17(1A) of the SEBI Listing Regulations, the age criteria for non-executive directors of listed company would operate not only at the stage of appointment but it would also operate when the non-executive director who has already been appointed has attained the age of 75 years. Application of Harmonious Rule of Interpretation vis-à-vis Literal Rule of Interpretation   The classic book on the subject of statutory interpretation (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edition, p. 28) states that the primary rule of interpretation (also called as ‘literal construction rule’ or ‘plain meaning rule’) is the golden rule of interpretation where the words of a statute must prima facie be given their ordinary meaning. It further states that according to the literal construction rule, ordinary words must be given their ordinary meanings and technical words their technical meanings, unless absurdity would result. Words that are reasonably capable of only one meaning must be given that meaning whatever may be the result. It is only when the words of a statute are unclear or unambiguous that other aids to interpretation are to be resorted to. Further, it is a settled principle of interpretation that where there appears to be inconsistency in two provisions of the same statute, the principle of harmonious construction should be followed. The essence of harmonious construction is to give effect to both the provisions. In the present case, the SAT applied the principle of harmonious construction for interpreting regulation 17(1A) and the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. However, it is interesting to note that there was no conflict in the two laws. In fact, the Act provides for filling up of casual vacancy by the board of directors of a company; however, there is no such provision under the SEBI Listing Regulations. Golden rule of interpretation for interpreting regulation 17(1A) of the SEBI Listing Regulations would have been more appropriate in this case, which would have also been in line with observations of the Division Bench of Bombay High Court in Sridhar Sundararajan. The SAT observed that the word ‘unless’ in regulation 17(1A) did not mean ‘prior approval’ and dismissed NSE’s observations that the requirement of passing a special resolution was a qualificatory condition for appointment of a person as a director. By applying the golden rule of interpretation to regulation 17(1A) under the extant case, prior approval of shareholders for appointment or re-appointment of any person as non-executive directors who have attained the age of 75 years would be a mandatory requirement, making it in consonance with the provisions of the Act. Taking into consideration the above analysis, the observations of the SAT deviate from the observations of the Division Bench of Bombay High Court on a similar set of provisions under the SEBI Listing Regulations and the Companies Act, respectively. It would be interesting to see whether the SEBI amends the SEBI Listing Regulations or prefers an appeal before the Supreme Court in this regard. – Gaurav Pingle Corporate Governance Independent Directors Interpretation of statutes SEBI"

        "read_on_content": [
            "Karvy Demat Case: How has SEBI Responded? By GuestJune 20, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Anant Budhraja and Praneeta Tiwari are 5th year BA-LLB (Hons.) students at West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences] The Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) on April 28, 2023, passed a stringent final order against Karvy Stock Broking Limited (“KSBL”) and its promoter Comandur Parthasarthy, whereby it banned them from accessing the securities market for seven years. Additionally, SEBI also imposed a cumulative penalty of Rs. 21 crores on KSBL and Mr. Parthasarthy for the violation of several provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the Securities Contracts Regulation Act, 1956. This has also been followed up by another recent order passed by SEBI on May 31, 2023, through which it has also cancelled the certificate of registration of KSBL. Such a harsh crackdown upon KSBL is a testament of the SEBI’s resolve to not allow the repeat of the mammoth scam which it alleges was spearheaded by KSBL along with its promoters and allied entities. In this context, SEBI has done much more than merely adjudicate the culpability of the perpetrators and the magnitude of their involvement with the scam. Rather, SEBI has taken simultaneous steps to eliminate the possibility of stock brokers misusing their clients’ securities for gaining a personal leverage. However, it is essential to analyze the newly introduced measures by SEBI in order to conclusively determine their efficacy over the past four years since the scam was unearthed. Hence, this post would attempt to address that particular issue by examining the regulatory measures introduced by SEBI over the years. Background  On June 20, 2019, SEBI issued a circular through which it barred the practice of pledging client securities for stock brokers’ personal loans, and hence ordered brokers to segregate client funds and securities by September 2019. As KSBL defaulted in complying with the aforesaid directions, an investigation was triggered by the National Stock Exchange (“NSE”), which informed SEBI of KSBL’s malpractice, wherein they pledged the securities of nearly 95,000 clients and raised approximately Rs. 2,300 crores via loans against shares from different banks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank, among others. Relying on the NSE’s report, SEBI passed an interim order on November 22, 2019, whereby it prohibited KSBL from taking on any new clients with respect to its stock broking activities and also directed the National Stock Depository Limited (“NSDL”) to allow the transfer of securities from KSBL to the respective clients who had lawfully paid in full against those securities. Subsequently, a string of orders and appeals followed, which ultimately culminated in discerning the culpability of KSBL and thereby prohibiting it from the securities market, as underscored previously. Analysis of SEBI’s Intervention As set out in the preceding paragraphs, it is pertinent to note that SEBI acted swiftly in recovering the losses. As on December 2, 2019, NSDL issued a press release notifying the return of nearly Rs. 2,013 crores to approximately 83,000 investors whose shares were illegally pledged by KSBL. Thereafter, SEBI passed a string of orders, circulars and directions, which aimed at curbing the possibility of such a widespread broker scam in the future. For a start, by way of a circular dated February 25, 2020, SEBI notified that the transfer of securities to the demat account of the trading members (“TMs”) or clearing members (“CMs”) for margin purposes would be prohibited. SEBI also aimed at enhancing transparency by implementing a pledge/re-pledge system, whereby the investors would be provided a complete trail on the status of their pledged securities through brokers, which were then re-pledged through CMs and Clearing Corporations (“CCs”). These changes were ushered in by the SEBI in order to reduce the limitless power exercised by brokers in utilizing the clients’ securities for margin requirements and pledging, without the clients’ knowledge, in order to obtain significant leverage against the same. Also, through a circular dated August 27, 2020, SEBI revised the guidelines for the execution of power of attorney (“PoA”) by the client in favor of the stock broker and/or depository participant (“DP”), such that it made the practice of giving PoA as an optional exercise, which could not be mandated by the stock brokers upon opening of the client account. SEBI further restricted the usage of PoA to only limited circumstances like pledging of securities to meet the margin requirements of the clients, so as to prevent the unfettered misuse of mandatory PoA by brokers like KSBL. It is essential to underscore that SEBI refined the legal framework surrounding the margin pledge/re-pledge system adopted by TMs and CMs through a circular dated July 20, 2021, whereby it mandated a daily reporting mechanism to be followed by TMs and CMs, in order to provide significant visibility of the client-wise collateral at all levels. SEBI also ensured that a web portal facility is provided by the respective CCs and stock exchanges (“SEs”), such that the clients can easily view and access the information regarding the disaggregated collateral which is reported by the TMs and CMs. Such a monitoring system, which is readily accessible to the investors, can be very effective in safeguarding their securities kept with the brokers, and enabling them to avoid any red flags pertaining to broker defaults. Thereafter, with a view to ensure that the collateral belonging to a client is only used towards the obligations of that client, SEBI in the afore-mentioned circular also issued a direction to that effect, which came into force from May 2, 2022. Now, despite these regulatory mechanisms in place, SEBI observed that there are significant existing risks related to potential over-reliance on the reporting of the TMs and CMs (collectively, the “members”) regarding the client-wise allocation, along with the threat of misuse of client collateral which is retained by the members and not passed along to the CC. These risks are often heightened in case of stock broker defaults, irrespective of their causation, and hence can negatively impact the usage of clients’ securities by the stock brokers and members, thereby shaking investor confidence in the securities market. Therefore, in order to mitigate the aforesaid risks, SEBI in its consultation paperdated January 17, 2023, proposed the implementation of the UPI-based mandate and block mechanism in the secondary market, such that the clients would be in a position to block their funds in favor of the CC, in their respective bank accounts, in order to indulge in secondary market trading. Through this method, they can easily avoid the difficulty of transferring the securities up front to the members. SEBI has envisaged to achieve the dual objective of eliminating the onerous and potentially risky burden of transferring securities in favor of the brokers and simultaneously allowing the investor to accrue interest on the blocked amount in their bank accounts. While the above-mentioned measures are welcome in solving the problem of rampant misuse of the investors’ funds, by way of its consultation paper dated February 3, 2023, SEBI cautioned against the looming problem of surplus funds of nearly Rs. 46,000 crores being held with the brokers and CMs as per the last running account settlement data of January 6, 2023. In order to rectify the same, SEBI has proposed the upstreaming of all the investor funds from the stock brokers and CMs to the CCs on a daily basis. Nonetheless, SEBI has allowed the CCs to place the surplus investor funds in very low-risk and liquid overnight money market instruments. It can be observed that such a move might hinder the floating income, in the form of retained surplus funds, which was hitherto enjoyed by the brokers and CMs, but it is a reassuring step towards regaining the investors’ confidence with respect to their securities lodged with the brokers. In a bid to further tighten the regulatory norms, SEBI through its recent circular dated April 25, 2023 directed all the brokers and CMs to restrain from the practice of pledging their clients’ funds and using that leverage to obtain bank guarantees, effective from May 1, 2023. Further, in case of already created bank guarantees against clients’ funds, SEBI has mandated their winding down till an extended period of September 30, 2023. Along with these directions, SEBI seems persistent to monitor the implementation of this circular as well, by ensuring a compliance certificate to be submitted to the SEs/CCs latest by October 16, 2023, which would play a crucial role in preventing the arbitrary misuse of the clients’ securities held with the brokers. Conclusion The catena of orders, circulars, consultation papers and directions issued by SEBI in the aftermath of the Karvy scam are welcome as they pave the way for the investors to regain autonomy over their securities held with the brokers, and restrict the latter from misusing the former’s funds for their own advantage. Nonetheless, it is pertinent to note that the fixing of loopholes in the regulatory system have still yielded nearly 32 broker defaults in the past five years. This brings to fore the burning question as to whether the extensive legal and regulatory mechanism is effectively implemented to address a situation like the Karvy scam. By SEBI’s own admission in the consultation paper of February 3, 2023, a plethora of client funds still remain parked with the brokers, which can lead to destabilizing defaults. Hence, it is the need of the hour that SEBI ensures an effective monitoring and check mechanism to do away with such perpetrators at the very initial stage, so as to avoid heavy losses to investors and simultaneously retain investor confidence in the securities market. – Anant Budhraja & Praneeta Tiwari SEBI Securities Regulation Stock Brokers"

        "title": "PMLA Framework on Virtual Digital Assets: Two Key Issues",
        "read_on_content": [
            "PMLA Framework on Virtual Digital Assets: Two Key Issues By GuestJune 19, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Jaideep Reddy is Counsel and Krati Hashwani a Senior Associate, Trilegal] The virtual digital asset (also known as crypto-asset or cryptocurrency) (VDA) industry is accustomed to legal ambiguity in India. There has been little in the way of legislative clarity, barring the specific income-tax regime introduced in 2022, and piecemeal measures such as a mandatory disclosure of holdings for companies under the Companies Act, 2013, and certain compliance requirements under the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) Directions, 2022. Two key missing pillars of a robust regulatory framework have been: (i) a licensing regime, overseen by a regulator, and (ii) a statutory anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime subjecting VDA intermediaries to reporting obligations. Observers were, therefore, generally pleased when, by a notification issued by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India (Notification) on 7 March 2023, a host of VDA intermediaries were classified as reporting entities (REs) under the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). The Financial Intelligence Unit – India (FIU) has also published on its website a set of guidelines known as the ‘AML & CFT Guidelines for Reporting Entities Providing Services Related To Virtual Digital Assets’ (FIU Guidelines) which have been stated to be effective from 10 March 2023. Classifying VDA intermediaries as REs under the PMLA, and hence bringing them at par with several other value intermediaries across sectors, such as banks, stock-brokers, real estate agents, and jewellers, was always a low-hanging fruit which did not require a legislative change, unlike a new licensing framework. Directionally, the move is positive as this brings VDA intermediaries and the transactions they process under the reporting umbrella, in line with international best practices. However, the Notification and FIU Guidelines still throw up some ambiguities. This post probes two of the less discussed but key issues associated with the new framework: (i) how the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) standards can be used to fill in interpretational gaps, and (ii) whether the FIU Guidelines have attained the status of binding law. FATF Standards as an Aid to Interpretation The FATF is an independent inter-governmental body that sets global AML/CFT standards (Standards) and monitors compliance with the Standards. Rather than a policy shift specific to the VDA sector, the Notification appears to come in anticipation of the FATF’s upcoming evaluation of India later this year. The Notification is one amongst a slew of measures under the PMLA by the Central Government in recent weeks, and VDA intermediaries are just one among the several classes of persons and entities newly included as reporting entities, in line with the Standards. The FATF evaluation will have important ramifications for India’s perception as an investment destination the international community. The language in the Notification and FIU Guidelines is highly similar to that of the detailed FATF Standards on VDAs. For instance, the definition in the Notification defining VDA service providers is almost verbatim to the definition in the FATF Standards. The FIU Guidelines too, borrow copiously from the Standards. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognised that domestic laws must be interpreted in harmony with international treaties and conventions. This doctrine has specifically been applied in the context of the PMLA and FATF Standards in the 2022 judgment of Vijay Madanlal Choudhury v. Union of India. Although the said judgment has been criticised severely, this particular principle that it recognizes is well-accepted. In this case, the Supreme Court took FATF interpretations into account while construing the PMLA. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that the Notification and FIU Guidelines are likely to, and should, be construed in light of the FATF Standards, which can be used to clarify certain ambiguities. While this blog cannot delve into the application of the FATF Standards to each ambiguity due to space constraints, some illustrations are discussed below. Under the Notification, an entity that carries out any of certain specified activities for or on behalf of another person in the course of its business will fall within the ambit of a ‘person carrying on designated business or profession’, which is a type of RE under the PMLA. One of the covered activities is  “safekeeping or administration of VDAs or instruments enabling control over VDAs”. This brings us to the question of certain ‘non-custodial’ VDA wallet service providers i.e., providers of software tools that allow users to store their own VDAs in a manner in which the user, rather than the service provider, has control over the VDA. This is the case where the user possesses the ‘private key’ (which can be loosely analogised to a password) associated with a VDA wallet, and the service provider does not. A bare reading of the Notification and FIU Guidelines gives no guidance as to whether such a service provider would be covered. However, the FATF Standards usefully provide that this limb of the definition would not typically cover software developers or providers of unhosted wallets who only develop or sell the software/hardware, and that it would instead generally cover custodial wallet service providers who have control of the private key. The FATF Standards also clarify that in the case of a multi-signature VDA wallet (which would have more than one private key), entities holding even one key which would be required for a transfer may be seen as having ‘control’ for the purpose of the definition. The Notification also covers the activities of exchanging between VDAs and fiat currencies, exchanging between one or more forms of VDAs, and transfer of virtual digital assets. This leads to the question of whether decentralised exchanges or decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, which often do not have a central owner and are governed using blockchain smart contracts, are covered by the Notification. The Standards shed light on these situations too, while the Notification and FIU Guidelines are silent. The Standards state that the provider of a DeFi software application would not be covered as an RE under the Standards, which do not apply to underlying software or technology. However, the Standards clarify that persons “who maintain control or sufficient influence in the DeFi arrangements, even if those arrangements seem decentralized” may be classified as REs if “they are providing or actively facilitating” covered activities. These two situations illustrate how the Standards can fill in the gaps where the extant PMLA framework on VDAs is silent. Legal Status of the FIU Guidelines The Prevention of Money-laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005 (PMLR), which set out various compliance requirements for REs, provide that guidelines may be issued by the ‘regulator’. This term is defined in the PMLR as follows (in relevant part): “a person or an authority or a Government which is vested with the power to license, authorise, register, regulate or supervise the activity of reporting entities or the Director [FIU] as may be notified by the Government for a specific reporting entity or a class of reporting entities or for a specific purpose.” For already regulated institutions such as banks, the interpretation is clear, as the definition points to the authority which licenses or supervises the RE (i.e., in this instance, the Reserve Bank of India). In turn, such authorities have issued detailed AML/CFT guidelines to their regulated entities. However, VDA intermediaries are not specifically licensed or supervised by any authority as of date. The question hence arises as to who is the ‘regulator’ for VDA intermediaries, as that would be the entity with the power to frame guidelines. The definition of ‘regulator’ also includes the Director, FIU, “as may be notified by the Government for a specific reporting entity or a class of reporting entities or for a specific purpose.” As of date, no such notification appears to exist notifying the FIU as the regulator for VDA intermediaries under this provision.  Curiously, the text of the FIU Guidelines does not state which authority has issued the document, and under which provision of law. It is also undated, though one of its provisions states an effective date of 10 March 2023. Courts have held that merely publishing a document on a Government website is not sufficient for the document to attain the status of binding law (In the matter of Scheme of Amalgamation of Wadala Commodities Limited with Godrej Industries Limited). The rule of law dictates that any binding law must be issued in accordance with procedure established by law. While the PMLR does not specifically provide that the regulator’s guidelines ought to be gazetted, the requirement of the ‘regulator’ being notified (in the absence of a licensing / supervising authority) is, in our view, a sine qua non under the PMLR. In that light, as of date, it is doubtful whether the FIU Guidelines are binding.   – Jaideep Reddy & Krati Hashwani Financial Markets Regulation"

            "Empirical Analysis of Legal Fees Data for Indian Companies By Umakanth VarottilJune 13, 20238 Min read1 comment   [Srinivasan Sankaraguruswamy is an Associate Professor of Accounting at the NUS Business School, National University of Singapore and Umakanth Varottil is an Associate Professor at the Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore] A significant challenge confronts legal departments of companies. On the one hand, the demand for legal services from external counsel continues to skyrocket given the increasing complexity of the legal environment in which companies operate and the onerous nature of compliance requirements. On the other hand, in-house legal teams have come under intense pressure from management to bring about drastic reductions to legal costs. Both the global financial crisis in the late 2000s and the pandemic more recently have focused the attention on practices of companies in the procurement of external legal services, compelling them to be more creative about arrangements with external counsel to extract greater value at competitive prices. These developments necessitate that legal procurement by companies be “increasingly data-and-metrics driven” and reliant on “evidence-based rationales for major reductions in legal spending”. The role of data analytics in modern legal engagement cannot be understated. At what stages during their lifecycles do companies spend extensively, if at all, on legal fees? What types of companies incur greater legal spending? Do larger companies necessarily spend more than smaller ones? Do companies with greater exposure to global markets spend more than those without? Do companies in certain industries spend more than companies in other industries? Despite the criticality of these questions in the sphere of corporate legal procurement, there are numerous obstacles to obtaining data on specific fee arrangements between corporations and law firms representing them due to the private nature of their relationship. Available studies regarding legal fees in various markets are either anecdotal, survey-based or limited to specific time-spans. In our recent paper, “Which companies pay more (or less) in legal fees? An empirical study of India” (free access available on the publisher’s website until July 12, 2023),[1] we seek to fill this gap through our empirical study using a comprehensive dataset of legal fees that corporations in India have incurred annually over a 30-year period from 1990 to 2020. To our knowledge, there is no prior academic work that analyzes legal fees incurred by corporations across multiple variables over such a long time-horizon. The study of the legal expenses in India is interesting for at least two reasons. First, India is unique in that data on legal spending are available over a sufficiently extensive period to enable a meaningful empirical analysis regarding the trends and determinants of legal fees that corporations expend. Second, India’s economic liberalization in 1991 caused its product and investment markets to open up, thereby enabling its corporate legal sector to grow exponentially. This presents us with an interesting setting to explore the various determinants of legal fees in such a market. Through our study, we show that several characteristics relating to the legal environment in India have been exhibiting an increasing trend over time. For example, the total legal fees spent in the economy each year have been increasing during the period of our study. However, during this time the size of the Indian economy has also been growing and, hence, we examine the average legal fees spent by a company each year, which has also been increasing over time. In terms of transactional legal work, there has been a considerable growth in investments (both foreign and domestic), capital raising, and other similar corporate transactions, all of which signify a growing demand for legal services. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) tend to appear in waves, and hence do not demonstrate consistent time trends. In sum, the legal environment has been rapidly expanding in India. Our study is based on a sample that consists of 174,921 firm-year observations of limited liability companies from the Prowess database, which meet the data requirements. The company specific determinants of legal fees spent by corporations are company size, export and import status, state of incorporation, significant corporate events, and industry membership. Company size is the most important determinant of legal fees, in that larger companies spend more on legal fees than do small company. We proxy for company size with the total assets of the company, and whether a firm is a multi-segment firm or not. Companies that export goods and services to other countries, or import goods and services from other countries, contend with laws in India as well as in the importing (or exporting) country and hence spend more on legal fees than companies which sell to or buy from only the domestic market. Four states, being Delhi, Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu are the most industrialized states in India and their courts have original jurisdiction over civil and commercial matters beyond a specified monetary value. The companies incorporated in these states spend more on legal fees than do companies incorporated in other states in India. Companies engage in significant corporate events like issuing securities, either in an initial public offering (IPO) or in a secondary equity offering. Companies also issue debt and commercial paper in the capital markets. External law firms play an important role in drafting and filing documents with regulators, vetting the prospectus related to the securities issuance and in advising the company on related legal issues. We find that companies that engage the capital markets to issue securities spend more on legal fees than companies who do not have any significant corporate events in a given financial year. A second type of significant corporate event is a merger or acquisition (M&A). Companies can be either acquirers or targets in an M&A transaction. Companies that are a party to an M&A have to structure the transaction, conduct due diligence, prepare and enter into contracts involving reams of documents, and file some of these documents with regulators, all of which are usually handled by external law firms who specialize in the legal aspects related to an M&A. Hence, we expect, and find, that both acquirers and targets spend significantly more on legal fees than do companies who do not have any significant corporate event in a financial year. Since significant corporate events are undertaken by specific types of companies, we use a propensity score matching process to obtain the above-described results. Extant accounting literature classifies the litigation risk of a company based on the industry of which it is a member. For example, one study codes high litigation risk companies as those which are in the biotech, computer, electronics, and retail industries. We find that technology companies and companies in the energy sector in India spend higher legal fees on average than do companies in other industries. We contribute to the literature in two significant ways. First, our paper is the first to describe the cross section of legal fees across companies in a single market over a sustained period of time. Such an analysis of legal fees is significant given the intense fee-sensitivity displayed by the legal market, the need for further data analysis for purchasers and providers of legal service, and the unavailability of public information regarding fees at the level of each engagement or even each purchaser-provider relationship for legal services. Second, we show empirically that larger companies spend more on legal fees. Companies who engage the stock market to issue equity or debt securities also spend more on legal fees. Both acquirers and targets in an M&A also spend higher amounts on legal fees. Companies in high tech and the energy industries spend more on legal fees, presumably because they face higher legal, contracting and regulatory risk. At one level, critics may argue that the findings in our paper are consistent with obvious expectations, but our effort herein is to empirically test the validity of conventional wisdom and available anecdotal evidence. Our findings regarding the determinants of legal fees would not only enable market players to calibrate these factors in structuring their engagements for legal services, but they would also provide the opportunity for researchers to analyze legal fees in other markets (subject to the availability of data) or to undertake further in-depth studies across one or more determinants of legal fees. Our paper would also contribute to the broader literature surrounding the legal profession, including any regulation surrounding the quantum and design of legal fees in India, and generate appropriate discourse in other related jurisdictions as well. – Srinivasan Sankaraguruswamy & Umakanth Varottil   [1] A preprint of the article prior to peer review is available on SSRN.

            "Material Adverse Government Action (MAGA): Need for a PPP Framework in India By GuestJune 6, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Sri Janani S. is a 3rd year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) student at National Law University, Jodhpur] In the recent years, public-private partnerships (“PPPs”) have been increasing manifold in India. The state is recognizing the private sector’s indispensable role in the infrastructure sector, urban water projects, healthcare and even in the development of electric vehicles. The Government is encouraging private investment by providing incentives, like the Viability Gap Fund and setting up of India Infrastructure Finance Company. It is important to note that India has no specialized statute governing PPPs. The entire framework depends on existing legislation such as the Companies Act, Contract Act and other policies and guidelines laid down in specific sectors. Renegotiations in Indian PPP contracts generally take place in situations like change in law, force majeure events, material adverse government action or political force majeure. These would allow for a change in terms and conditions necessitated by external circumstances beyond the control of the concessionaire or contracting party.  In light of this, the concept of Material Adverse Government Action (“MAGA”) becomes pertinent. MAGA is also referred to as political force majeure, where one party to the contract is the government or any state instrumentality. According to a report published by the World Bank, such clauses aim to allocate particular types of political risk to the contracting authority.  Since there is the absence of any exhaustive legislation on this subject in India, this post seeks to examine the importance of MAGA clauses, how the courts have interpreted these clauses and how this vague interpretation and lack of PPP legislation in place can lead to serious concerns to such partnerships. Importance of MAGA & Interpretation of MAGA Clauses by the Indian Courts “Material Adverse Change” clauses are quite popular in mergers and acquisitions, where it aims to guard the acquirer against significant changes that makes the target company less attractive. In such PPP contracts, the risk of MAGA is allocated to the contracting party. The private party will then be able to claim compensation for the losses suffered due to the action/inaction of the government.  Risk allocation in a PPP contract is quite different from a conventional contract, proving to be much more complex. Both parties must understand and agree to the division/allocation of risks amongst themselves. It becomes even more critical, as PPP contracts are for a longer tenure than a conventional contract. Building trust and cordial relationships between both parties becomes extremely crucial during such a period. In light of its importance, it would be essential to examine some cases involving MAGA or political force majeure clauses. In a Bombay High Court case of Sion Panvel Tollways Pvt. Ltd v. The State, Sion Panvel entered into a concession agreement with the Government after a competitive bidding process. They had stated that there was an unjustified delay in issuing toll notification, due to which they suffered losses. After it was issued late, the petitioners further contended that the Government did not comply with the requirements of the agreement.       According to a clause in the agreement, if the government, by an act of commission or omission, creates circumstances that have a material adverse effect on the performance of its obligations by the concessionaire and has failed to cure the same within 60 days of notice thereof, these shall constitute events of default. The concessionaire will have the right to terminate the agreement and be entitled to receive termination payment per the given condition. The Court directed the Government to pay compensation accordingly.  In a Supreme Court case of Unitech Ltd. v. Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation, the political force majeure event impacted the project as a material adverse effect. According to the terms, if this were the case for nine months, the developer is entitled to terminate the contract upon issuance of notice. These political force majeure events included litigation relating to the title of APIIC or the Government of Andhra Pradesh. In such situations, Unitech was entitled to compensatory payment from the Government. The Court held that the fundamental postulate on which the entire contract was founded stood nullified due to the failure of title. This entitles Unitech to claim a refund.  However, it is pertinent to look at the clause stipulating what happens in the event of political force majeure. A termination clause of this nature generally reads as follows:  “either party to this agreement may issue a notice of termination of this agreement if a non-political force majeure vent has resulted in material adverse effect on the project for more than nine months. On the other hand, the developer shall be solely entitled (but not obligated) to issue notice of termination of this agreement, if a political force majeure event has resulted in material adverse effect on the project for more than nine months.”  An exploration of this clause depicts that the private sector is not bound to issue a notice of termination in case of political force majeure events, putting the Government in a vulnerable position. These types of clauses seem problematic, as although MAGA safeguards the agreed returns of the private sector, the concern is whether it may be overextending such safeguards under the garb of “protecting” the investments made by the private sector.  In another Bombay High Court case of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation Ltd. v. Plus Bksp Toll Ltd., the concession agreement was validly terminated under specific clauses. Political force majeure was defined under the agreement as “events by on or account of any governmental agency”. The termination by Plus was held to be valid due to a political force majeure event, such delays in land acquisition and approval from railways, non-payment of toll by government buses, and change in the law banning the entry of heavy vehicles. Although termination on certain clauses was held invalid, the Court held that it could terminate the contract on other clauses which were valid. Therefore, most MAGA actions are incorporated and defined under the political force majeure events, like change in law, based on the parties’ discretion. However, the precise language of these MAGA clauses remains a disputable issue. For instance, the definition of what constitutes “change in law” may be limited or ambiguous in concession agreements. If we also look at how these material adverse effect clauses are used in areas of mergers and acquisitions, it demands more clarity due to the absence of any guideline or framework.  On the one hand, sellers, i.e., the government, may prefer very specific and definite clauses, with some exceptions related to general risks and macroeconomic events. On the other hand, the buyers, i.e., the private sector, may desire a broadly and vaguely-worded clause to cover any possible risk. For instance, in the case of Adani Power, the Supreme Court held that a change in law in Indonesia would not qualify as a “change in law” in India.  Conclusion In the absence of a regulatory framework, a worrisome trend as that of some countries might start in India. For instance, in the Philippines, the clauses were worded very generally, where MAGA is sometimes considered a final, unappealable and executory decision, thereby circumventing the judicial power. Although the precedents set out under the Indian Contract Act do not allow for such clauses, the real question of drafting these terms becomes relevant. Countries like the UAE and the USA have laws and regulations for PPPs, and they have displayed positive signs of progress in such projects. The Indian Government attempted to formulate a Draft National PPP Policy; however, it has not taken shape yet. Several international guidelines have been formulated in this regard, like the UNCITRAL Guidance on PPP/Concession Laws, 2000, but the application of such guidelines to Indian PPP contracts is questionable, as they are merely “guiding” in nature.  The trend in India shows that the courts have been quite liberal in interpreting these clauses and directing the government to compensate. While these clauses are essential to ensure the bankability of the contract, they can also lead to overprotecting the private sector and disincentivizing the government. Clauses relating to tackling of externalities is just one aspect. There are other stages in a PPP contract, like dispute settlement and dispute resolution, which can be further strengthened through a proper legal foundation. All of these reiterate the importance of having a solid framework in place to avoid boilerplate clauses or one-sided clauses and bringing in a system of consistency and certainty. A balance has to be struck to achieve “partnership” in its real sense.  – Sri Janani S. Contract Law Partnerships Regulation"

        "read_on_content": [
            "ClientEarth-Shell: English Court Rejects Climate-Focused Shareholder Derivative Suit By Umakanth VarottilJune 5, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [This post was first published in the Oxford Business Law Blog] In a closely watched litigation in the climate change space, ClientEarth, a non-profit environmental law organisation based in the United Kingdom, instituted a shareholder derivative suit against the directors of Shell plc. The claim is based on the allegation that the directors breached their duties under the Companies Act 2006 by not taking sufficient action by way of climate risk management, including implementation of energy transition measures consistent with the Paris Agreement and adherence to an order of a Dutch court that relates to reduction of Shell’s emissions in a time-bound manner. While ClientEarth held only 27 shares of Shell, it received the support of shareholders holding 12.2 million shares representing approximately 0.17% shares. It also obtained letters from holders of another 12.5 million shares whose stated position is aligned with that of ClientEarth. However, in a decision rendered on 12 May 2023 involving the question of whether ClientEarth must be granted ‘permission’ to continue the action, an English court dismissed that claim on the ground that there was no prima facie case for the grant of such permission (in terms of section 261(2)(a) of the Companies Act 2006). In this post, I discuss three principal takeaways from the ruling based on the reasoning of Mr. Justice Trower who rendered the judgment. (Implicit) Business Judgment Rule The principal claim of ClientEarth rests on sections 172 and 174 of the Companies Act 2006. Section 172 contains the duty that requires directors to act in good faith to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. The statutory provision also recognizes that in doing so the directors can have regard to several other interests, including ‘the impact of the company’s operations on the community and the environment’. Section 174 encapsulates the directors’ duty of care, skill and diligence. ClientEarth argued that these duties requires directors to act in a precise manner to address climate risk. However, the Court refused to accept that there were specific obligations on directors on how the company’s management and affairs ought to be conducted to address climate risk. Instead, it focused on ‘the well-established principle that it is for directors themselves to determine (acting in good faith) how best to promote the success of a company for the benefit of its members as a whole’ (at para 19). In arriving at this conclusion, the Court relied on well-known English dicta in Re Smith & Fawcett Limited [1942] Ch 304 and Howard Smith v. Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821. The Court suggested that directors’ obligations to address climate risk are not uni-dimensional, as ClientEarth suggests, but that directors are required to account for several competing considerations and weigh them on balance. Courts would, therefore, be averse to dictating to corporate boards (either by themselves or based on prescriptions by shareholders) how they should perform their duties in reality. That is a matter for boards’ discretion to be exercised on a real-time basis. Mr. Justice Trower observed that ‘the evidence does not support a prima facie case that there is a universally accepted methodology as to the means by which Shell might be able to achieve the targeted reductions’ (at para 47). Through this, the Court appears to impose a high onus on plaintiff shareholders to establish on the basis of the available evidence that the decision of the board ought to be one that no board member would consider to be in the interest of the company. In that sense, if several avenues are available to the board to consider the various interests and to promote the success of the company for the benefit of the members, the decision of the board would not be called into question merely because it went down one path rather than any other.  By deferring to the decision of the board to determine the manner of discharge of their duties to address climate change, the Court adopted the business judgment rule in substance. Although English company law does not incorporate a statutory business judgment rule (unlike jurisdictions such as Australia and Malaysia), courts have historically refrained from second-guessing boards on business matters relying upon decisions such as Smith & Fawcett and Howard Smith. This ruling too follows suit. Efficacy of the Relief The Court was also confronted with the issue of the nature of the relief sought by ClientEarth and the prospects that the Court would be able to grant such relief if the proceedings were to continue. It noted that ‘there is no doubt that a court will not grant mandatory injunctive relief if constant supervision is required, which will be particularly acute as a factor if the relief sought is insufficiently precise’ (at para 55). Here, the judge found that the nature of the mandatory injunction sought by ClientEarth fell afoul of the above basic principle.  For these reasons, the Court found that ClientEarth failed to make a prima facie case for the relief sought on the basis of a breach of directors’ duties. Hence, in terms of the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 relating to shareholder derivative suits, the judge had no option but to deny permission to ClientEarth to continue to pursue the claim against the directors on behalf of Shell. Good (Bad) Faith Although the decision of the Court rested solely on the finding that there is a lack of a prima facie case, the judge went on to make observations on the question of whether ClientEarth was acting in good faith when it brought a derivative claim, because that is one of the additional considerations in determining whether a plaintiff shareholder can be allowed to pursue such a claim (see section 263(3)(a) of the Companies Act 2006). To that extent, one may argue that this part of the ruling is obiter dicta. The fact that ClientEarth held a small proportion of shares in Shell seemed to matter, as that would disentitle it from seeking relief on behalf of the company on a claim that is complex, time-consuming and expensive. Additional observations seem to impose an unduly high onus on climate-activist turned plaintiff shareholders while bringing such climate-related claims, as the Court found that ‘ClientEarth has adopted a single-minded focus on the imposition of its views and those of its supporters as to the right strategy for dealing with climate change risk’ (at para 65). Even though ClientEarth also garnered the support of a large number of other shareholders, that appeared not to matter in legitimising its motivation. The Court found that nearly all the shareholders supporting ClientEarth were not only members of the Climate Action 100+ engagement initiative, but that they also signed their letters of support in a common template. Moreover, the fact that 88.4% votes were offered in support of Shell board’s climate plan at its annual general meeting on 18 May 2021 was considered to be a factor that the Court must have regard in determining the future of ClientEarth’s application.  Key Learnings: Way Forward At the outset, ClientEarth’s derivative claim and the initial ruling of the Court speak to the purpose and impact of environmental activists initiating corporate litigation on climate risk. A recent working paper shows that in certain cases the mere fact of climate litigation initiated against a company (regardless of the success of the litigation) can impact the share price of the company. Based on a database of 108 climate change lawsuits initiated against listed corporations in the US and the EU, between 2005 and 2021, the paper notes that ‘a filing or an unfavourable court decision in a climate case reduced firm value by -0.41% on average, relative to expected values’. This demonstrates that investors perceive a loss of value through management distractions and reputational damage merely by the fact that climate lawsuits are initiated against corporations. Returning to the Shell case more specifically, three points are noteworthy. First, the ruling makes clear that climate-related corporate decision-making is complex and requires a number of competing considerations to be carefully weighed by corporate boards. Courts will not impose their own views (or that of the shareholders) on how boards ought to address climate risk. In that sense, the controversy surrounding the Shell decision is not about whether climate risk affects corporations (which has been neither negated by Shell nor the Court), but about the precise manner in which boards are required to mitigate the risk. If the ruling stands, plaintiff shareholders may have to focus on companies or situations where the boards have adopted a stance (through actions or omissions) which no board would normally embrace in addressing climate risk. To that extent, the ability of plaintiff shareholders to call into question board decisions would be limited to the rather extreme or egregious cases of climate agnosticism on the part of corporate boards.  Second, the nature of the relief sought matters significantly. Plaintiff shareholders may be compelled to focus on reliefs that are not only precise in nature, but those that do not require constant monitoring by the courts.  Third, the observations of the Court on the element of ‘good faith’ dilutes the ability of environmental activist groups in acquiring shares in companies for the purpose initiating corporate climate litigation of the nature witnessed in the ClientEarth-Shell case. Such activists would necessarily have a ‘single-minded focus’ on strategies for addressing climate risk, an aspect that was considered to affect the bona fides of ClientEarth in the case at hand. The fact that the Court expected ClientEarth to adduce ‘sufficient evidence to counter the inference of collateral motive’ (at para 65) imposes an undue obligation on plaintiff shareholders to demonstrate good faith. However, given that the Court’s observations on matters of good faith are arguably obiter dicta, the extent to which they define the lay of the land for corporate climate litigation remains to be seen. Despite the importance of the ruling on prima facie case, matters do not culminate here. The decision was a preliminary one rendered based on the parties’ written submissions. ClientEarth is entitled to seek within seven days of the judgment an oral hearing requesting the Court to reconsider its decision. ClientEarth has, unsurprisingly, exercised that right, and the matter now moves to the next stage of oral hearing. Climate activists and corporate boards alike would continue to watch the developments in this litigation very closely. Climate Change Company Law Directors International Developments"

            "Supreme Court Ruling: Admission of Corporate Insolvency a Norm, Rejection an Exception By GuestJune 3, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Megha Maiti and Subhasmita Routray are legal counsels at Mercedes-Benz Financial Services India Private Limited] Section 7(5) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) lays down the power of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to either accept or reject an insolvency application filed by a financial creditor. The issue of whether the said power is mandatory or discretionary in nature has witnessed many contradictory precedents, from the case of Innoventive Industries v. ICICI Bank to the case of Vidarbha Industries Power Ltd. v. Axis bank Ltd. The Supreme Court of India on 11 May 2023 has finally shed some clarity on the judicial interpretation of this section through its verdict in the case of M Suresh Kumar Reddy v. Canara Bank and explained its rationale behind the prior judgements passed. This post attempts to analyse the observations made by the Supreme Court of India on various precedents while delivering their verdict in M Suresh Kumar Reddy. It proposes the need for a legislative amendment to achieve the objective of the IBC, i.e., to provide the resolution of insolvency disputes in a time-bound manner while maximizing the value of the assets of the corporate debtor. Judicial Development of Powers of NCLT under Section 7 of the IBC The role of the adjudicating authority under section 7(5) was dealt with in the cases of Innoventive Industries and ES Krishnamurthy v Bharath Hi Tech Builders Pvt. Ltd.  whereby the Supreme Court of India specified the limits of jurisdiction of the NCLT in admitting an insolvency application under section 7(5). It was stated that if the financial creditor can prove that the corporate debtor has a “debt” and that they have “defaulted”, the NCLT shall admit the application filed by the creditor without entering into the merits of the case. The intent of this provision was taken in a separate direction when the Supreme Court in Vidarbha Industries Power Ltd gave a new meaning and interpretation to the word “may”. This was indeed a major diversion from the settled law in the case of Innoventive Industries, which has been followed and cited throughout the years. The bench in this judgement gave discretionary power to the NCLT, which may admit or reject the application after considering the merits of the case. The rationale behind this was to ensure that temporarily insolvent companies can revive themselves to clear the default and are not put at an unfair disadvantage or penalised by the resolution process. The discretion given to the NCLT by the literal interpretation of the clause was not in consonance with the intent of the act that then led to the Vidarbha Review case. The review petition highlighted the diversion from major landmark judgements like Innoventive Industries and E.S. Krishnamurthy, where it was held that NCLT’s powers are limited to ascertaining the existence of debt and the same being unpaid for admission of an application. However, the bench dismissed the review petition and upheld the original judgement by clarifying that the said stand was taken after taking into consideration the peculiar facts of the case. The bench also highlighted the judgement in E.S Krishnamurthy based on which the review petition was filed, and stated that the case nowhere dealt with the question of the NCLT’s power being discretionary or mandatory during admission of an application. Rather, it addressed the issue of whether the NCLT, while deciding whether to admit or reject an application, has the power to impose a settlement on the parties who are not ready to settle. Ruling in the M. Suresh Kumar Reddy case In the M Suresh Kumar Reddy, Syndicate Bank (the financial creditor) sanctioned a loan to Kranthi Edifice Pvt. Ltd. (the corporate debtor) in the form of a secured overdraft facility and bank guarantee in favour of the Telangana Government. Later, the corporate debtor requested an extension of the bank guarantee as the Telangana Government was likely to encash the guarantee. The bank rejected the request and asked the corporate debtor to repay the entire debt. In December 2019, an application was filed before the NCLT under section 7 of the IBC by the financial creditor. During the pendency of the same, the High Court of Telangana in April 2022 passed an interim order restraining Syndicate Bank from taking any coercive steps. Meanwhile, the NCLT application was admitted by the bench in June 2022. An appeal to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) filed by the director of the corporate debtor was also dismissed by the bench. Hence, the current petition before the Supreme Court was filed, questioning the admissibility of the application by the NCLT Hyderabad Bench. The Supreme Court observed that “once NCLT is satisfied that the default has occurred, there is hardly a discretion left with NCLT to refuse admission of the application under Section 7. ….. Thus, even the non-payment of a part of debt when it becomes due and payable will amount to default on the part of a Corporate Debtor. In such a case, an order of admission under Section 7 of the IB Code must follow. If the NCLT finds that there is a debt, but it has not become due and payable, the application under Section 7 can be rejected. Otherwise, there is no ground available to reject the application.” Thus, the Court upheld the view taken in the cases of Innoventive Industries and E.S Krishnamurthy and highlighted that if the debt of the corporate debtor is due and payable, then the NCLT shall accept the application of the financial creditor. Only in cases where the debt is not due and payable can the said application be rejected. The division bench of the Supreme Court categorically held that the Vidarbha review case has nowhere overruled the Innoventive Industries case and rather elucidated that the judgement was made in the context of the case at hand and should not be read as a proviso to the statute. Thus, the admission of an application by the NCLT if “debt” and “default” are proved is the general norm, and rejecting such an application can only be an exception to the same. Need for Legislative Amendment Section 7(5) of the IBC lays down two grounds under which the NCLT “may” accept a claim filed by financial creditors, provided that the application filed by the financial creditor is complete and there is no ongoing disciplinary proceeding against the proposed resolution professional.  The corporate debtor is in debt. The corporate debtor has defaulted on the debt.  The Supreme Court, in several precedents, has established that the power of the NCLT is mandatory under section 7(5) of the IBC. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs, by way of a consultation paper dated January 18, 2023, has also proposed an amendment to section 7 of the IBC to amend the word “may” to “shall” in the provision, consequentially making it mandatory for the NCLT to admit an application where the occurrence of default is established. However, if the provision becomes mandatory, then how does one address exceptions that crop up in cases like Vidarbha Industries Power Ltd? From a conjoint reading of the concerned provision and the multiple precedents in this context, it can be concluded that the power of the NCLT to admit or reject an application may vary on a case-by-case basis depending on the facts of the case, hence leaving a lot of room for confusion. Thus, it is proposed that the legislation should undertake a more objective approach in clarifying the kind of unpaid debt, like disputed/undisputed, existing/contingent or temporary debt, so that the same can be referred by the NCLT in order to adjudicate on the acceptance or rejection of a section 7 application. Hence, an amendment in this regard would not only lay out a proper framework for the NCLT to adjudicate on the admissibility of a claim filed by a financial creditor, but it would also bring in more uniformity and fairness in its adjudication. Conclusion It is clear that there is a lot of ambiguity in determining the jurisdiction and powers of the NCLT on whether to accept or reject a claim under section 7(5) of the IBC. The Supreme Court of India has tried to clarify its stance on legislative intent as and when an appeal is filed before it. The various challenges, though, still exist, as there are now multiple precedents on this issue and the average time for admission of an application by the NCLT has increased largely. The main objective of NCLT, which is quicker resolution, has now come into question with such unanswered or ambiguous answers in place. However, the said ambiguity can be resolved with strong legislation in place which, though makes the NCLT’s power mandatory in nature, also highlights the exceptional scenarios where the NCLT can have discretionary powers. – Megha Maiti & Subhasmita Routray Insolvency"

            "SEBI’s Regulatory Focus: Examining AIF Investors’ Excuse And Exclusion Rights By GuestMay 31, 20235 Min read1 comment   [Shreya Singh is a 5th year B.B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) student at National Law University, Odisha in Cuttack, Odisha] Over the past decade, the alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) regime (which structures in the private equity and venture capital investment) in India, has experienced substantial expansion. Private equity investments in India reached a cumulative value of $44 billion between 2015 and 2020, accompanied by an upward trend in average deal size from $40 million to $65 million during this timeframe. As a result, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”), which oversees the AIFs, has placed greater emphasis on modifying and enhancing the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012. These changes aim to foster greater transparency and address various other aspects. Most recently, SEBI, through its circular issued on February 5, 2020, introduced disclosure standards for registered AIFs via a private placement memorandum (“PPM”) template. This template encompassed various disclosures, including those pertaining to “Excuse and Exclusion” and “Direct Plan for investors and fees charged by AIFs.” However, SEBI identified inconsistencies and transparency issues in the disclosed information, prompting the issuance of new guidelines through circular dated April 10, 2023 (“the Guidelines”). These updated guidelines aim to establish consistency in the disclosures made within the PPM, thereby enhancing the regulatory framework. Meaning and Implication of Excuse and Exclusion Rights Excuse rights provide investors with the ability to opt out of certain investment opportunities for various reasons. These rights are typically supported by a range of factors. Firstly, regulatory or legal restrictions may exist that limit investors’ participation in specific deals. Secondly, excuse rights can be invoked on religious grounds, allowing investors to avoid investments that go against their moral or ethical beliefs. Thirdly, investors may have established policies, such as ESG policies, which dictate their investment decisions. Excuse rights come into play when proposed investments conflict with these policies, enabling investors to abstain. Lastly, some investors have investment restrictions in place, be it specific asset types, activities, or jurisdictions, and excuse provisions grant them the option to decline deals that violate these restrictions. In addition to the excuse right, an investment manager may seek to exclude an investor from certain investments if the investor’s participation would result in a violation of applicable laws, potentially causing significant harm to the fund or other investors. This exclusion serves as a corollary to the excuse right, allowing the investment manager to prevent the involvement of an investor when their participation could have negative consequences due to legal non-compliance. Usually, the conditions in which the excuse and/or exclusion provisions are triggered are typically predetermined through initial agreements between investment managers and relevant investors in the contribution. Alternatively, such conditions may be outlined in a separate, more confidential side letter arrangement. What the SEBI Circular Entails In February 2020, SEBI introduced a template for private placement memorandums (PPMs) to promote consistent information disclosure among AIFs. However, the disclosed details concerning excuse and exclusion rights fell short of SEBI’s standards, displaying inconsistency and inadequate disclosure. Certain AIFs, especially those with institutional investors, received permission to deviate from the SEBI format, resulting in additional discrepancies in disclosure. As a result, SEBI, in consultation with Alternative Investment Policy Advisory Committee (AIPAC) issued a circular that specifies the circumstances in which an AIF can excuse or exclude investors from participating in an investment opportunity. When the Investors Can be Excused According to the SEBI Guidelines, the investors can request to be excused from participating in a specific investment opportunity in two situations. The first situation arises when the investor’s participation would result in a violation of applicable laws or regulations. In such cases, the investor must provide supporting evidence in the form of an opinion from a legal professional or advisor confirming the potential violation. Additionally, investors can also be excused if their involvement in the investment would contravene their disclosed internal policies, as stated in the contribution agreement or any other agreement with the AIF. If there are any changes to these internal policies, the investor must notify the AIF within 15 days of the modification. When the Investors Are to be Excluded In a circumstance where the investor’s participation in a specific investment opportunity would result in the fund violating applicable laws or regulations or causing significant harm to the fund, the investment manager, according to the circular, has the authority to prevent the investor from taking part in that investment opportunity. The investment manager has the discretion to exclude the investor from the opportunity and is required to document the reasoning behind the exclusion, including any relevant supporting documents, if applicable. In the guidelines, SEBI also includes fund of funds, where an AIF (acting as an investor in another fund) may be partially excused or excluded from participating in an investment opportunity. This applies to the extent of the contribution made by the underlying investors of the said fund or investment vehicle who are also excused or excluded from the same opportunity. The investment manager of the AIF will be responsible for documenting the reasoning behind such excuse or exclusion, including any supporting documents, if available. Conclusion SEBI’s recent guidelines on excuse and exclusion rights in alternative investment funds aim to simplify the disclosure process and provide specific criteria for when an investor may be exempted from participation. These guidelines, supported by the requirement for a legal opinion in investor-requested exclusions, enhance transparency and prevent selective deal selection under the guise of excuse rights. By limiting the investment manager’s ability to grant excuse rights through side letters, the guidelines set clear boundaries for negotiations and help preserve the integrity of ‘blind-pool’ fund structures. Overall, these measures contribute to a more standardized and transparent framework for managing excuse and exclusion rights in AIFs, ensuring the fair and efficient operation of the investment ecosystem. – Shreya Singh Alternative Investment Funds SEBI Securities Regulation"

            "SEBI’s Circular on Transition Bonds: Can it Combat Greenwashing? By GuestMay 31, 20238 Min read1 comment   [Vatsal Jain and Vedant Bhardwaj Singh are 3rd year B.A., LL.B. (Hons) students at Hidayatullah National Law University] On 4 May 2023, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’), by way of a circular titled ‘Additional requirements for the issuers of transition bonds’ (‘Circular’) laid down certain additional compliance measures for the issuance of transition bonds to prevent the misallocation of funds, and to ensure transparency and fight against greenwashing. Transition bonds are investment tools designed to finance projects aimed at facilitating the transition to a greener and more sustainable economy. The Circular mandates that the issuer would denote the transition bonds with the title ‘GB-T’ on the cover page of the offer document and the relevant areas on the term sheet. The issuer needs to disclose a transition plan as well. Tenets of the transition plan would include interim targets to reduce emissions, an indicative timeline to complete the transition, an implementation strategy, details on the usage of the technology and a mechanism to check the usage of funds raised through these transition bonds. The issuer is obligated to disclose to the stock exchanges all the revisions along with explanations during the pendency of the project. Moreover, the annual report of the issuer company shall include a brief regarding the implementation of the transition. The Circular further empowers the stock exchanges to monitor the disclosures made under this Circular. The Circular is drafted solely for transition bonds. It is an extension to the circulars titled ‘Revised Disclosure Requirements for Issuance and Listing of Green Debt Securities’ (‘Circular on green debt securities’) and ‘Dos and don’ts relating to green debt securities to avoid occurrences of greenwashing’ (‘Greenwashing circular’) dated 6 February 2023 and 3 February 2023 respectively. The introduction of transition bonds can help solve the issue of unsustainable practices followed by certain companies and industries and play a crucial role in fulfilling India’s environmental obligations. Based on the aforementioned premise, this post underscores the reasons for the introduction of these additional compliance measures by SEBI and provides a comprehensive review of the regulatory mechanism of transition bonds. International Hesitancy on Transition Bonds The field of transition finance has largely overlooked transition bonds. Currently, the market is teeming with apprehension against these bonds. Since the first sale of transition bonds in 2017, they have been struggling for relevance. As of June 2021, only $7.3bn has been raised through sales of these bonds. Only Japan and China are endorsing the use of transition bonds. However, as of February 2023, the Japanese government is yet to issue its first transition bond. The fears find their rationale based on the International Capital Markets Association’s (ICMA) hesitancy in acknowledging the legitimacy of these bonds. Since ‘transition’ is a continuous process rather than a product, it has been unable to garner a proper definition with tangible criteria. The ICMA puts these bonds on a pedestal lower than the green or sustainability bonds. It refuses to recognize such an instrument as a standalone financing method and regards it as a ‘label’ given to sustainability-linked or green bonds. Thus, there is a visible lack of transition principles to provide a structure to these transactions. The Semantic Challenges in Defining Transition Bonds In SEBI (Issue and Listing of Non-convertible Securities) Regulation,2021 (‘Regulations’), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’) has sub-categorized transition bonds as ‘green debt security’ under regulation 2(1)(q)(xii). It is defined as the funds acquired for transitioning to a sustainable form of operation that is in line with the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (‘INDC’) by India as determined in COP21 and COP26. Though SEBI’s efforts are laudable, the definition suffers from a lot of inconsistencies. The definition makes a reference to the Paris Agreement. More specifically, the form of operation should meet the 1.5-degree Celsius requirement under the Agreement. However, there are still a lot of discrepancies regarding the choice of mechanism to meet the aforementioned requirements. The definition has failed to acknowledge this polarity.  For example, one of the mechanisms recommended by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (‘IPCC’) is the ‘offshoot’ method where the temperatures go beyond 1.5-degree Celsius for a few decades, only to come down before 2100. However, SEBI’s definition is unclear as to how such a mechanism will be interpreted. Companies could use it to raise funds for transition but continue their unsustainable business practices for decades without violating the tenets of the definition. Moreover, considering the outline presented by SEBI, it should be noted that the tangible requirements of the INDCs are subject to change. Any such change by the Government on an international platform may affect the recognition of already transitioning projects and their planned trajectories. Magnification of the Greenwashing Quandary by Transition Bonds Coined by Jay Westerweld in 1986, greenwashing is an activity where the companies make unsubstantiated and exaggerated claims on their sustainability to give them an environment conscious image. In addition to the apparent negative effects that these misleading claims will have on ethics, the environment, and society, free riders gain an unfair economic advantage over ethical businesses. The concerns can be better highlighted by Volkswagen’s ‘Clean Diesel’ campaign, where the company claimed that its diesel cars had lower emissions. However, an investigation proved to the contrary. The nitrous oxide emissions were four times more than the permissible limit. The Circular aims to legitimize the use of transition bonds by mandating additional disclosures. However, it has neglected to address the issue of ‘greenwashing’, which could affect investor confidence and is inconsistent with the current government’s aim for the green economy. In the absence of universally accepted taxonomies, the only regulatory framework that exists on the subject is a greenwashing circular released by SEBI on 6 February 2023. The greenwashing circular places certain compliance burdens on the issuer of green debt securities. The issuers shall not make unsubstantiated claims that create a false impression regarding certification from a third party. The issuers are obligated not to present misleading labels, hide trade-offs or cherry-pick data that is favourable to their cause. In addition to that, the greenwashing circular lays down a continuous disclosure operation to ensure that the steps undertaken by the issuer are realistically contributing to a greener society and not merely existent on paper. When viewed from the lens of transition bonds, the greenwashing circular fail to prevent greenwashing on several counts. Firstly, the greenwashing circular fails to take into account the suggestions provided in the 2022 G20 sustainable financial report to generate legitimacy behind the commitments made by the financial institutions. At a time where transition bonds suffer from a lack of credibility, SEBI has failed to lay down an institutionalized mechanism to create uniformity regarding the evaluation of transition plans. SEBI’s failure to take cognizance of the same can result in a myriad of inconsistencies given the loose and incomplete definition of transition bonds as discussed above. Secondly, given that transition bonds come under green debt securities, the growth of this instrument can be hindered by the greenwashing circular as it incorporates arbitrary terms such as ‘cherry picking’ of data and ‘quantifying’ negative externalities. SEBI is silent on what mechanism is to be adopted for the quantification of negative externalities. Furthermore, the lack of restraints on the scope of ‘cherry picking’ can lead to inconsistencies during the evaluation of a disclosure report. This problem is exacerbated when one looks at the sweeping powers of SEBI provided under Chapter 7 of the Regulations. The Board can restrict the market access of the persons concerned. Thus, without a proper framework on greenwashing, such powers may discourage potential issuers under the apprehension of violation of natural justice. Currently SEBI has merely laid down a general oversight on greenwashing concerns and transitions bonds. Perhaps it can incorporate some tenets from the mechanism adopted by the United States. The latter has a regulatory framework that consists of guidelines not just related to the raising of transition funds but also consumer products. They lay down steps to differentiate between greenwashed and real green products. Furthermore, they also have a dedicated task force for the same.   Conclusion In conclusion, while the Circular by SEBI demonstrates a step towards promoting sustainable finance through transition bonds, addressing the challenges of international hesitancy, definitional clarity, and combating greenwashing is crucial for ensuring the credibility and effectiveness of these bonds in fulfilling India’s environmental obligations. Furthermore, the Circular places the responsibility of monitoring sustainable actions on the issuer, which leaves room for manipulation and continuation of greenwashing practices. The lack of stringent punitive measures for violations also weakens the enforcement of these guidelines. To enhance the effectiveness of the Circular and foster the growth of transition bonds, SEBI should consider incorporating suggestions from international frameworks and regulatory practices. Establishing clear and uniform evaluation criteria, adopting a framework to differentiate between greenwashed and genuine green products, and introducing a dedicated task force could strengthen the credibility and acceptance of transition bonds. – Vatsal Jain & Vedant Bhardwaj Singh Capital Markets Climate Change Disclosure Requirements SEBI"

        "read_on_content": [
            "Position of a Seller of an Immovable Property under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 By GuestMay 31, 202310 Min readAdd comment   [Lavanya Pathak and Pallavi Mishra are advocates practicing in the Delhi High Court] Under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), there is a clear scheme of categorization of creditors for the purpose of initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process (“CIRP”). This categorization lies at the core of the waterfall mechanism for distribution of assets prescribed under section 53 of the IBC. While the waterfall mechanism applies to a very limited extent during the resolution process, as prescribed under section 30(2), the categorization brings with itself plethora of rights including inter alia the right initiate the CIRP, the right to file a claim, voting rights in the committee of creditors (“CoC”) and minimum entitlement in the resolution plan or liquidation process under section 30(2) or section 53, as the case may be. As such, it is often a matter of great debate as to whether a ‘debt’ would be in the nature of an ‘operational’ or ‘financial’ debt. While the law is settled as to the treatment of many classes of creditors, lately, a question regarding the treatment of the debts of a seller of an immovable property, such as a land, has raised a conundrum.  This post particularly delves into examining the treatment to be accorded to a ‘seller of an immovable property’ under the IBC based on considerations extending to: (i) necessity of ‘disbursal’ to constitute ‘financial debt’; (ii) exclusion of immovable property from the definition of ‘goods’ under the definition of ‘operational debt’; and (iii) the ambit of ‘other creditors’ as category of creditors. The post concludes along the lines that the claim of a seller of an immovable property arising out of a sale agreement can neither be treated as a financial debt nor an operational debt but may be included within a separate category of “other creditors” under the IBC. While this conclusion is derived from the legislative intent and judicial proceedings, the authors examine the effect of holding as such on the rights of this category of creditors, and suggest a way forward. Necessity of ‘Disbursal’ to Constitute ‘Financial Debt’ Primarily, to assess whether a person may be categorized as a financial creditor, the existence of a debt is a sine qua non. Keeping this assessment in view, it is pertinent to note that the nature of a sale agreement usually either involves an auction of the underlying immovable property or payment of consideration, either paid upfront or in installments with imposition of an interest rate. In the context of the nature of the sale agreement, an argument that may arise is whether in case of payment owed to a seller in installments for sale of an immovable property, the imposition of interest can qualify as a “debt” under the IBC. According to the authors’ view, primarily, a seller of an immovable property cannot be treated as a financial creditor as the dues of the seller arise against the installment sums payable for the sale of property, and not pursuant to any ‘debt’ which was ‘disbursed’ to the corporate debtor. Under section 5(8) of the IBC, ‘financial debt’ has been defined as under: “Section 5(8): “Financial Debt” means debt alongwith interest, if any, which is disbursed against the consideration for the time value of money.” Consequently, for a ‘debt’ to qualify as a ‘financial debt’, two ingredients must be satisfied: there must be a ‘disbursal’ of debt; and such disbursal must be against the time value of money. In Anuj Jain, IRP for Jaypee Infratech limited v. Axis Bank Ltd, the Supreme Court held that any of the transactions stated in the sub-clauses (a) to (i) of section 5(8) would fall within the ambit of financial debt only if it carries the ‘essential elements’ as stated above. The Supreme Court reiterated the necessity of ‘disbursement’ in Pheonix Arc Pvt. Ltd. v. Spade Financial Services Limited and Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd v. Union of India. The Court quoted the Black’s Law Dictionary on the meaning of the word disbursement” to mean “(t)he act of paying out money, commonly from a fund or in settlement of a debt or account payable….for a particular purpose.” Additionally, with respect to the status of a seller of an immovable property, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (“NCLAT”) in Namdeo Ramchandra Patil v. Vishal Ghisulal Jain dealt with the question of dues of a landowner under a joint development agreement and held that it shall not be treated as a ‘financial debt’, since there was no disbursement as it was “not a case where an amount has been raised from the Appellants – the Landowners”. These observations of the NCLAT were also confirmed in Ashoka Hi-Tech Builders Pvt. Ltd. v. Sanjay Kundra. Hence, based on the first test of the necessity to constitute ‘financial debt’, the seller of an immovable property cannot be held to be a financial creditor since under a sale agreement a seller is not disbursing any debt to the corporate debtor, but merely claims dues against the sale of land. Exclusion of Immovable Property from the Definition of ‘Goods’ under the Definition of Operational Debt In addition to the above test, the seller of an immovable property cannot also qualify as an “operational creditor” within the meaning of section 5(20) of the IBC since the definition of “operational debt” as given under section 5(21) means a claim in respect of the provision of “goods and services”. It is settled that the sale of land cannot be considered a “service”. To see whether ‘land’ can be considered a ‘good’ under section 5(21), reference is to be placed on the definition of “goods” under section 2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act: 2(7). “goods” means every kind of movable property other than actionable claims and money; and includes stock and shares, growing crops, grass, and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale. It is crystal clear that immovable property is excluded from the scope of ‘goods’ and, as such, a seller of land cannot be held to be an ‘operational creditor’ under the IBC since land does not qualify as ‘good’ . The NCLAT in Somesh Choudhary v. Knight Riders Sports Private Limited has also considered the definition of goods under the Sale of Goods Act to determine whether dues against sale of trademark would constitute an ‘operational debt’ under the IBC. While relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in Vikas Sales Corporation v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, it was observed that “even incorporeal rights like trademarks, copyrights, are ‘Movable Property’ and are included in the ambit of definition of ‘goods’ under the provisions of Sale of Goods Act, 1930.” However, despite the expansive interpretation given by the NCLAT, it is rather obvious that dues arising from the sale of immoveable property cannot be included under the definition of goods under section 2(7) of the IBC. ‘Other Creditors’ as a Category of Creditors Who are Neither Operational nor Financial Keeping in view the foregoing discussion, the legislature was conscious that within the scheme of the IBC there may be categories of creditors whose debts are neither financial nor operational in nature. Therefore, in 2017, by way of an amendment to the IBBI (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 (“CIRP Regulations”), a new ‘Form F’ was introduced for submission of claims by creditors other than financial and operational creditors. Regulation 9A of the CIRP Regulations provides for a detailed process for filing of claims by ‘Other Creditors’. Considering the intent and purpose of having a residuary provision for the claims of creditors not having a financial or operational debt, the seller of immoveable property should be treated under the ambit of ‘Other Creditor’. In Shubhankar Bhowmik v. Union of India, the High Court of Judicature at Tripura, as upheld by the Supreme Court, held that a decree holder who does not fall within the definition of an ‘operational creditor’ or a ‘financial creditor’ is liable to be treated as ‘other creditor’. The observations of the Court in this regard as reproduced as under: “15. Since the claims cannot be classified as operational or financial, appropriate provisions (Regulation 9A) and forms (Form F) for filing of claims is provided in the IBBI (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016. This is also reflected in the title to Form F which reads “Proof of Claim by Creditors (Other than Financial Creditors and Operational Creditors).” In light of the foregoing judgement, it is the authors’ view that an applicant who is claiming dues as a seller of land under a sale agreement is liable to be treated as ‘other creditor’ as the pre-requisites of ‘financial debt’ and ‘operational debt’, as defined under the IBC, are not met. Protecting the Rights of Sellers of Immovable Property The authors find that the scheme of the IBC is clear in as much as the sellers of immovable property can neither be treated as financial nor as operational creditors. However, this raises a perplexing situation in cases where the corporate debtor, being a developer, has started real estate projects on the land, against which the dues of the seller have not been cleared. On one hand, taking away the land during the CIRP process would virtually frustrate resolution and, on the other, it is imperative that the landowner get their legitimate dues. To determine whether there will be any adverse repercussions by treating such creditors as ‘other creditors’, it is important to analyze the different between treatment of various category of creditors under the IBC.     Basis   Financial Creditors   Operational Creditors   Other creditors     Right to apply to NCLT   Yes   Yes   No     Right to participate in CoC   Yes   No   No     Right to receive funds under the Resolution plan   No mandatory minimum requirement under the IBC; dissenting financial creditors liable to be paid minimum liquidation value   Entitled to minimum liquidation value   No mandatory minimum requirement under the IBC     Priority under Section 53, IBC   Depends on whether such creditor holds any security   Depends on whether such creditor holds any security   Depends on whether such creditor holds any security     While there is no difference in treatment in the event of liquidation as section 53 uses the words ‘secured’ and ‘unsecured’ creditor, it is clear that for the purposes of resolution, the IBC seems to be designed such that while financial creditors are given voting rights in the CoC, operational creditors are given minimum entitlements to ensure their treatment is not prejudicial. ‘Other creditors’ are not protected beyond the general mandate of ‘fair and equitable distribution’ under the resolution plan and will also have no right to initiate CIRP. However, it is the understanding of the authors that, practically, such a treatment will not be prejudicial for this category of creditors since the transfer of their immovable property, which generally forms an integral part of the estate of the corporate debtor, would be subject to their consent and the consent of the adjudicating authority when waivers or concessions are sought by the resolution applicant. Thus, it will be incumbent on the successful resolution applicant to provide adequate treatment of their dues. – Lavanya Pathak & Pallavi Mishra Insolvency Property Law"

            "Shareholder Protection under IBC: A Myth or a Possibility By GuestMay 31, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Dhruv Kohli is a 4th year B.A.LLB student and Sanya Singh a 4th year B.S.W LLB student, both at Gujarat National Law University] Ever since the enactment of the Insolvency and the Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), there has been a shift in the debt resolution mechanism in India. Unlike its predecessors, the IBC is a creditor-centric legislation, which can be ascertained from the fact that once there is advent of corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) under the IBC, it is the committee of creditors (CoC) which assumes all the powers and undertakes all the decisions pertaining to the corporate debtor. The decisions as taken by the CoC are said to possess the “commercial wisdom”, through which they can be questioned only if they are against the provisions of IBC or its objectives. In cases where publicly listed companies undergo CIRP, the CoC often approves resolution plans that involve delisting the company and a complete write-off of equity shares. This significantly impacts non-promoter public shareholders (minority shareholders), who bear the brunt of such decisions. In response to concerns raised by minority shareholders, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has introduced a protection framework to safeguard their interests during CIRP of public-listed companies. The present post analyses the protection as proposed by SEBI. It seeks to explore the present position of minority shareholders and the feasibility of the protection as proposed. The authors conclude by finding that not only is the protection representative of a myopic view of the IBC but it is also legally untenable. Present Position of Minority Shareholders under IBC  Presently, minority shareholders occupy a relegated position under IBC. Neither do they have any representation before the CoC nor is their consent required for any act as it is “deemed” to be given. Additionally, the shareholders in general fall last in the waterfall mechanism that is provided under the IBC. The Proposed Protection  Through a consultation paper issued in November 2022, SEBI has made the following proposal:  Resolution applicant (RA) to offer minority shareholders the opportunity to acquire equity in the new entity. A maximum of 25% can be offered by the RA and there must be a minimum acceptance of 5%. This would have to be done through a mandatory open offer. Minimum 5% public shareholding is to be ensured to continue the listing of the entity post-CIRP. Delisting to be permitted only if 5% acceptance is not achieved even through the mandatory open offer. Review of the existing delisting regulations should also be undertaken wherein exemptions should only be given when either the entity undergoes liquidation or when public shareholding remains below 5%.  Whether Shareholders Need any Protection  An important question that arises for consideration is whether minority shareholders need any protection. If the recently concluded CIRP of public-listed companies is considered, it can be clearly seen that the minority shareholders suffer the most. For instance, in the CIRP of DHFL, there was a complete reduction in the paid up share capital of the company, that too at a cost of zero. Again in Jaypee Kensington Boulevard v. NBCC (India) Limited, the resolution plan envisaged a complete reduction of the paid up share capital at a negligible cost and the same was even approved by the Supreme Court. Such resolution plan does not take into consideration the investments made by the public, who often lose everything in such cases. It is precisely such “unfair treatment” which in the opinion of SEBI is unacceptable and needs to be remedied. Feasibility of Protection  Having looked at the intent with which SEBI has come up with this proposal, we now move onto analyse the proposal as to whether its implementation is legally feasible or not. For the same purpose, an important question that arises is whether SEBI is legally empowered at the first place to propose any such protection or not. Section 11 of the SEBI Act, 1992 assumes importance here. It deals with the powers and function of SEBI, wherein section 11(1) imposes a duty upon SEBI to implement such policies which are aimed towards protection of investors in the securities market and also undertake steps that aid in the overall development of the securities market. Thus, when the proposal is read in light of section 11(1), it can be deduced that SEBI is acting upon the duty that is imposed upon it by the statute as it seeks to protect the investors of public listed companies who stand to lose all of their investments once the company undergoes CIRP. However, the proposal is also to be read in light of the provisions of the IBC and not just the SEBI Act, as the proposal, if brought into force, is going to affect modifications not just to provisions of the SEBI Act but also cause material changes in the IBC. To understand whether such material changes are permitted within the scheme of IBC or not, section 238 of the IBC becomes important. The said section is a non-obstante provision which means that in the event of a conflict of the provisions of IBC with any other law, the former is to prevail over the latter. In this regard, the question arises whether the protection for minority shareholders as envisaged by SEBI is in line with the provisions of IBC. The Bankruptcy Law Reform Committee report of 2015, which formed the basis for the existing IBC had noted that “sound bankruptcy process, the equity value of the enterprise would be wiped out and the existing shareholders would lose control”. It also had observed: “When default takes place, control is supposed to transfer to the creditors; equity owners have no say”. The logical deduction that can be made from these observations is that the drafter of the IBC envisaged a situation wherein there is a complete reduction of the share capital and the equity shareholders lose everything. This deduction is further strengthened by the judgment of the apex court in Jaypee Kensington Boulevard v. NBCC (India) Limited. In this case, minority shareholders of Jaypee Infratech Limited challenged the resolution plan on the ground that the resolution plan envisages a complete dilution of the equity which in essence is against the provision of IBC. The Court not only dismissed the contention but also held that the “the grievances as suggested by these shareholders cannot be recognised as legal grievances and does not provide them any cause of action to maintain”. The decision not only refutes the basis on which SEBI has proposed this framework but also established that in the substantive scheme of IBC there is no place for shareholder protection as well. Further, what emerges from the above analysis is that by attempting to exercise its powers under section 11(1), SEBI is directly in contravention to section 238 of IBC (and in essence to the entire code as well) and, thus, it becomes important to see whether any sort of reconciliation between the two is possible or not. Since both the statutes are special laws, the only question that arises is which would have an overriding effect over the other. In this regard, the Supreme Court noted in Maharashtra Tubes Limited v. State Industrial and Investment Corporation of Maharashtra that when there is a conflict between two special laws with no possibility of harmonious construction possible, the latter enactment prevails over the former. By the application of the same in the present case, the provisions of IBC would prevail over that of the provisions of SEBI and thus powers of SEBI under section 11(1) cannot be exercised in a manner that it goes against the provisions of IBC. In other words, SEBI is legally not empowered to propose the framework as the same is in a direct conflict to the provisions of the IBC. Conclusion While the intent with which SEBI introduced the framework was laudable, it has failed to take into account the fact that any such framework would have to comply with the provisions of the IBC. As can be seen from the above analysis, in the overall scheme of the code, there is no protection that is envisaged for equity shareholders, By proposing the same, SEBI action is arguably in direct contravention with the provisions of IBC which ought to prevail over the powers of SEBI. Moreover, any form of protection that leads to a change in the overall scheme of the code should come not from SEBI but from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India as the latter being the insolvency regulator of the nation is more well suited to undertake any form of substantive change to the IBC. – Dhruv Kohli & Sanya Singh Insolvency SEBI"

            "Reevaluating the Independence of Credit Rating Agencies: Time for Stricter Norms? By GuestMay 30, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Akanksha Dutta is a final year student of the 3-year LLB course at Government Law College, Mumbai] Credit Rating Agencies (“CRAs”) in India play a very vital role in determining the overall financial health of a company as well as the safety of the securities issued by such companies. The assessments made by CRAs assist investors, both large and small, in evaluating the risk linked to the securities and determining the most suitable matches for their investment portfolios. The CRA regulations define the term “rating” as “an opinion regarding securities, expressed in the form of standard symbols or in any other standardised manner, assigned by a credit rating agency and used by the Issuer of such securities.” Credit rating is, thus, in essence, a process for evaluating the relative degree of risk associated with the timely servicing of debt and then presenting this information in a standardised format. In a recent order by the SEBI in the matter of CARE Ratings, the interference of the top management in the rating of securities was brought to light. More importantly, the order threw fresh insights on the internal working of top rating agencies in India. It demonstrated the veto powers enjoyed by the directors of such entities and how a rating is manipulated. Such orders reinforce the dire need for a more independent and transparent rating system for Indian securities. The Shortcomings of the CRAs and the SEBI Regulations A key issue with the regulatory framework governing CRAs is the issuer-pay model wherein the issuer of the security selects the rating agency and then enters into a rating agreement on payment of an upfront fee. The payment arrangement entered between the issuer and the CRA compromises the quality and objectivity of the rating assigned. Therefore, there is a need for the SEBI to determine a more objective and independent fee structure. The SEBI vide circular dated  3 May  2010 specified additional “Guidelines for Credit Rating Agencies”, attempting to resolve this conflict of interest in the issuer-pay model. It directed the separation of the business development and the rating vertical of the CRAs. The restriction intended to separate the employees involved in the fee negotiation from other employees who are involved in the rating analysis to mitigate the possibility of the rating being affected by the fee charged. Additionally, a circular dated 1 November 2016 restrained the Managing Director and the CEO of the CRA from being part of the rating committee if a majority of the members of such committee are not independent. However, these provisions lack stringency and have not been able to completely strike off the bias. Also, there was a recommendation made by the Standing Committee on Finance in its report titled “Strengthening of the Credit Rating Framework in the Country” that the regulator must consider options such as “investor-pays Model” or “regulator-pays model” to remove the conflict of interest. The investor pay model, specifically, could provide a fairer rating to the investors based on their needs. However, this model was used abundantly prior to the 1970s but was found to be unsustainable. This is because a general publication can be easily copied and also, the issuers are generally willing to pay a higher amount for the service as it helps them improve the cost of capital. The regulator-pays model on the other hand, can potentially improve contractibility and foster competition. If the regulator is in charge of selecting the CRA, it can effectively evaluate the quality of the ratings and reward this choice. However, both these options will require a lot more study and improvements before they can be given effect. In addition to the shortcomings of the issuer-pay model, the agency after entering into the agreement, analyses the company and the security based on the information received by the client and other reliable sources available to the public. A review note is then prepared which is sent to the client for approval. The agency’s independence is impeded by this approach, and it would be preferable for the CRA to reveal the initial rating instead of first sending the rating for the client’s approval. It was seen during the IL&FS fraud, that even after having adequate knowledge of the company’s deteriorating financial position, the ICRA, CARE and India Ratings and Research Private Ltd. failed to downgrade the rating of the company. The disparity in the press release of IL&FS and the disclosures made to BSE, was reason enough for the CRAs to be more prudent in their approach and yet, higher reliance was placed on the submissions made by the company. Moreover, it is the regulator who must authenticate the documents sent by the company to the CRA and must play a more active role in the rating process. Currently, there are about six major rating agencies in India namely, the ICRA, CRISIL, CARE, Infomerics Valuation and Rating Private Ltd., India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd. and Acuite Ratings & Research Ltd. Even though there are several other small rating agencies, given the high barrier to entry in the credit rating industry, it becomes difficult for the smaller rating agencies to compete with the established agencies. Consequently, this creates a cartel like environment which provides a passage for inefficiency and corruption. Due to their dominant position in the market, the major CRAs have significant bargaining power. This can potentially result in exploitation, as they may use this power to negotiate fees or other favorable terms with their clients. It was seen in the matter of Brickworks Rating Private Ltd, wherein the fee charged by the CRA was lower than that agreed in the contract. This deduction was after a meeting of the issuer with the founding director of the agency. It is a clear principle of the CRA regulations, that a person involved in the analytical process cannot engage in the business development. However, this is only one of the many instances that have come to light. Another factor contributing to limited competition is that corporate issuers tend to trust and rely on one or two rating agencies, making them reluctant to be rated by others. Corporate issuers prioritize the ratings that investors trust the most, as this facilitates placement and results in the lowest spread, creating a natural oligopoly. It is a given, that the market for CRAs shall always remain an oligopoly, but the market competition even between a small number of CRAs should be based on reputation for quality ratings. There are two ways to address the abuse of power. First, is for the new entrants in the credit rating landscape to focus on the quality of the rating rather than inheriting the bigger market share. A reputation for quality created over a period of time will help curb the conflict of interest in the issuer-pay business model. Secondly, the regulator-pay model, as discussed above, could bring more entrants into the industry as the SEBI could incentivize the quality and independence rather than merely the reputation or the relationship built over the years. Another possible solution could be to have a framework for mandatory rotation of CRAs for a single issuer. This would aid in avoiding the negative consequences that arise from long term associations between the issuer and a CRA.  This is particularly significant considering the recent instances of failure of CRAs identifying trouble in their client-entities. Further, the Finance Ministry may also provide for ratings to be compulsorily carried out by more than one agency. Lastly, the provisions of the SEBI regulations seem to be unduly liberal. There needs to be enhanced disclosures norms for the CRAs. This could include mandating disclosures of the methodology used for rating, disclosure of the conflicts of interest, and disclosure of the track record of the rating agency. Further, the SEBI should also consider stricter enforcement of the existing regulations and rules governing the CRAs. This could include more frequent inspections and audits of the rating agencies, as well as stricter penalties for non-compliance, perhaps linked to the size of the issue rated. A rating fee cap could also be an impactful amendment to provide a level playing field to the smaller agencies. Conclusion The highlighted discrepancies in the issuer-pay model have constantly been an issue, and the first major step towards a discrete credit rating process would be to amend the model or to suggest an alternate model for selecting the agency. Even though the SEBI through its frequent circulars is constantly trying to bring about a transparent and investor-centric rating system, we need a radical change in approach before we can have a “conflict of interest-free” rating system. – Akanksha Dutta Credit Rating SEBI"

            "Perpetuating an Anomaly: What is the “Prescribed Period” for Challenging an Arbitral Award? By GuestMay 18, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Rhythm Buaria is an advocate practicing commercial and matrimonial disputes before courts in Delhi] The Supreme Court in Bhimashankar Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane Niyamita v. Walchandnagar Industries Ltd. (WIL) held that a challenge to an arbitral award under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 cannot be entertained under the proviso to section 34(3) even if the 30-day period expires on a holiday or during court vacation. Section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act prescribes a three month period for challenging an arbitral award with a further period of 30 days if the award debtor can show sufficient cause for delay in presenting the challenge within three months. This ruling, the author argues is based on an incorrect application of the law and divests the award debtor from exercising a very valuable right which in any case is severely restricted under the statute. Facts The facts germane to the present analysis are: i) an arbitral award dated 24 August 2016 was passed against Bhimashankar which it received on the same day; ii) Bhimashankar filed a challenge against this arbitral award on 2 January 2017; and iii) the 30-day period under the proviso to section 34(3) for the purposes of this challenge expired on 24 December 2016 during the currency of court vacation which commenced on 19 December 2016 and ran until 1 January 2017. Submissions of the parties  Several submissions were made on either side. The submissions actually considered by the Court and relevant to the present discussion are stated below. The main plank of Bhimashankar’s submission was that section 10 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 would be applicable to proceedings under section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. The effect being: Bhimashankar’s filing of the challenge to the arbitral award on the day immediately after the court vacation ended would in law be considered as a challenge within the prescribed period and therefore maintainable. This submission was based on the underlying principle of section 10 of the General Clauses Act which is, that a party cannot be compelled by law to do an impossible act. Bhimashankar further argued that non-applicability of section 10 of the General Clauses Act would lead to unequal treatment as some award debtors would be able to take refuge under the proviso to section 34 while others similarly placed would not have the benefit of this rule on account of fortuitous circumstances. Bhimashankar also argued that section 4 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (which is inapplicable to all proceedings to which the Limitation Act is not applicable) when it speaks about expiry of ‘prescribed period’ (see section 2(j)) on a day the court is closed does not deal with statutorily condonable period and this vacuum could be filled by section 10 of the General Clauses Act which is wider in import. In view of the above, Bhimashankar argued that the Supreme Court’s decision in Assam Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Board v. Subash Projects and Marketing Limited ruling that section 4 of the Limitation Act was inapplicable was incorrect, inasmuch as the Court in that case did not consider section 10 of the General Clauses Act. Finally, Bhimashankar argued that in any case the Limitation Act was not applicable to a proceeding under section 34 of the Arbitration Act and therefore, section 10 of the General Clauses Act would be applicable. WIL on the other hand heavily relied on Assam Urban and argued that the 30-day period under the proviso to section 34(3) did not fall under the meaning of ‘prescribed period’ under section 4 of the Limitation Act. It was therefore of little consequence if this period expired during the court vacation. WIL also relied on Consolidated Engineering Enterprises vs. Principal Secretary, Irrigation Department and Government of Maharashtra v. Borse Brothers Engineers and Contractors Pvt. Ltd. to argue that the Limitation Act is applicable to the Arbitration Act (albeit in a limited sense) which precluded the application of the General Clauses Act. Judgment and Analysis The only question that arose before the Court in the facts and circumstances was whether section 10 of the General Clauses Act would apply to proceedings under section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act which it answered in the negative. In coming to this decision, the Court followed Assam Urban. It is submitted that Assam Urban considered the Supreme Court’s judgment in Union of India v. Popular Construction Co. which specifically held that section 5 of the Limitation Act stood excluded from application to proceedings under section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act in view of section 29(2) of the Limitation Act. However, the Court in Assam Urban as well as in the present case failed to launch an enquiry into the applicability of sections 4 and 2(j) to the Arbitration Act which is a special statute (see Popular Construction). This enquiry which ought to have been made (in view of section 29(2) of the Limitation Act) would lead to the conclusion that section 4 of the Limitation Act is inapplicable to proceedings under section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. The reasons for this conclusion are these. section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act is a complete code insofar as it prescribes the time period within which an arbitral award can be challenged which is three months plus 30 days. The latter being premised on the ability of the award debtor to satisfy the court about the existence of “sufficient cause” for not filing the challenge until that point. It is submitted that to deprive Bhimashankar of an opportunity to even explain the delay would render the proviso to section 34(3) otiose in circumstances which were beyond its control. This, could not have been the intention of the legislature as is clear from a plain reading of the relevant provision. The language of section 34(3) is clear in that an award debtor as a matter of right can file an application challenging an arbitral award anytime during the 120 days (three months plus 30 day period). Whether the application will be entertained if filed in the extended 30 day period is the only matter left to the discretion of the court. It is submitted that the Court erred inasmuch as it failed to give effect to the true intention of the provision as evinced from a plain reading of the provision. The Court also erred by applying the definition of ‘prescribed period’ under section 2(j) which expressly states that it means “period of limitation computed in accordance with the provisions of this Act.” As pointed above, the period of limitation for making a challenge under section 34 is computed according to section 34(3) of the Act and not the Limitation Act. Therefore, the definition under section 2(j) could not have been imported to the Arbitration Act. The above discussion leads to the conclusion that section 43(1) of the Arbitration Act which states that the Limitation Act would be applicable to proceedings under the Act would not be applicable to a proceeding under section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act. Consequently, an award debtor could successfully argue that section 10 of the General Clauses Act would be applicable in facts like that in Bhimashankar. Pertinently, the proviso to section 10 expressly states that it would not apply to any act or proceeding to which the Limitation Act applies. A proceeding under section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act not being hit by the Limitation Act would therefore follow the General Clauses Act. The Court’s finding in Bhimashankar to the contrary lays down incorrect law as it fails to take notice of previous decisions of the Court on the applicability or inapplicability of the Limitation Act to different proceedings under the Arbitration Act  . Conclusion It is submitted that the right to explain sufficient cause under the proviso to section 34(3) is distinct from the right to be heard on merits of the challenge to the arbitral award. While the former is predicated on filing of an application to explain the delay, the latter is predicated on the satisfaction about the explanation. The Supreme Court’s interpretation of the relevant provisions in Bhimashankar is erroneous inasmuch as it treats it as one and the same thing. The prescribed period therefore for filing an application under section 34(3) of the Arbitration Act is three months plus 30 days, the latter of which too cannot be curtailed on account of fortuitous circumstances. In any case, a challenge made in the extended period can always be thrown out by the court even if the award debtor is given the full benefit on this period by excluding the number of days lost on account of non-working of the court. For now, the Court has missed an opportunity to correct the wrong precedent set a decade ago. – Rhythm Buaria Arbitration Limitation"

            "Constitutionality of Section 327(7) of the Companies Act 2013: Sanctity of the Waterfall Mechanism By GuestMay 13, 20235 Min readAdd comment   [Simran Malhotra is an Associate at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, New Delhi] In Moser Baer Karamchari Union v. Union of India (2 May 2023), workmen unions challenged the constitutionality of section 327(7) of the Companies Act (“Act”) for excluding preferential payment for workmen’s dues over other dues as provided under sections 326 and 327 of the Act in the event of liquidation of a company under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“Code”). Dismissing the batch petitions, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the statutory provision, thus in turn preserving the sanctity of the waterfall mechanism under section 53 the Code. The waterfall mechanism provides for distribution of proceeds of sale to different classes of creditors of a company going into liquidation in order of priority, wherein workmen dues come second in priority along with debts owed to secured creditors in the event they have relinquished their security under section 52 of the Code. Section 327(7) of the Act was introduced by way of an amendment in 2016 to bring uniformity in payment to different class of creditors as provided under the Code. Calling such amendment as a necessity in light of the waterfall mechanism under the Code, the Court declared the provision to be neither arbitrary nor violative of the provisions of the Constitution of India. The judgment of the Court is an important precedent for the following reasons It safeguards the waterfall mechanism thus further the objectives of the Code The waterfall mechanism under the Code is a critical economic allocation process aimed at the maximising the value of a corporate debtor that has meet with liquidation. The waterfall mechanism ensures that different classes of creditors are compensated fairly and equitably based on their contribution to the company while also considering the interest of other stakeholders such as the employees and shareholders. For instance, the rationale for having secured financial creditors who have relinquished their security higher up in the ladder and only next to cost incurred on insolvency resolution process and liquidation costs is because they have in economic terms provided monetary assistance to the company and have borne risk associated with the same, which in objective terms is much higher when compared to other forms of creditors. The entire scheme of the waterfall mechanism is based on the prioritising creditors who have borne more risk and have higher stake in the company. Thus, the judgment not only upholds the statutory preserving of rights of the stakeholders but, by not altering the waterfall mechanism, it also instils investor confidence in the entire system. It considers that the Code aims to accord enough protection to the workmen rights The Code provides an adequate safety mechanism to protect the interest of the workmen of the corporate debtor: for instance, section 36(4)(a) of the Code specifically provides that employment benefits given to the workmen such as provident fund scheme, pension fund and gratuity fund are kept out of the purview of liquidation assets.  Further, to preserve the liquation assets and for ensuring that the interests of the workmen are protected in cases where the secured creditor opts to realise their security interest under section 52 of the Code, regulation 21a of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 provides a safety net. The regulation provides that the secured creditors realising their secured interest have to pay as much towards the costs of the insolvency resolution process as well as liquidation costs and workmen dues for a period of 24 months preceding liquidation commencement date to the liquidator within 90 days from the liquidation commencement date. Pertinently, even in the event the secured creditor relinquishes its secured interest in the asset and is ranked pari passu with workmen dues, the workmen dues are calculated for a period of 24 months preceding liquidation commencement date which, as defined under section 5(17) of the Code, is much earlier in time and does not necessarily coincide with the winding update, thus providing them a larger window. The judgment of the Supreme Court is also important because it is line with various earlier dictums of the Court preserving the waterfall mechanism. Reliance can be placed on Sunil Kumar Jian v. Sundaresh Bhatt, wherein the Court not only preserves the waterfall mechanism but also notes that under the Code “workmen dues have been duly protected and provident and pension fund have been excluded from the liquidation estate assets”.  Conclusion In a developing economy like India, the Code plays a critical role in promoting credit market development, providing a time bound resolution to distressed companies, ensuring value maximisation of the assets of the company and, mostly importantly, protecting the interests of all stakeholders. Through this judgment, the Supreme Court has reiterated the principle that the benefit of whole take precedence over the benefit of the sole. Under the predecessor regimes to the Code, the process was not only marred with long delays, but the overall benefit of the company was not considered. What the judgment also ensures is that there is not multiplicity of claims from different classes of stakeholders who, in their merit, feel that their interests should be prioritised over the other. Further as the Court stated, “some sacrifices have to be made for greater good”. For, when the company is going into the process of liquidation, all stakeholders are taking a haircut to make the system just and equitable, therefore one class of stakeholders’ demand to be prioritized over others when there is already adequate safety net in place is not only unreasonable but also untenable in the larger scheme of the Code. – Simran Malhotra Companies Act Insolvency"

            "The Remedy for a Corporate Break-Up: A Framework for Cross-Border Demergers in India By GuestMay 13, 202310 Min readAdd comment   [Ishika Garg is a 4th year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) student at the NALSAR University of Law] Navigating the legalities associated with cross-border demergers (‘CBDs’) has always been a tricky task. The Indian position on this subject has been especially muddled, with a lack of sufficient clarity from both the legal enactments and judicial forums. A post on this Blog has previously noted how the existing laws can be purposively interpreted to include the regulation of such demergers in India. It is submitted that this view is correct as a wider interpretation of India’s cross-border restructuring framework would indeed help build a conducive environment to invite a greater flow of foreign direct investment and support the government’s policy of ease of doing business. However, it is the author’s opinion that a matter this important should not be left to judicial discretion. Only a separate framework can adequately address the intricacies associated with this restructuring option. Drawing upon the praiseworthy features and taking care to avoid the pitfalls of the legal provisions for cross-border demergers in the European Union (‘EU’), this post proposes a comprehensive framework to recognise and regulate these demergers in India. Analysing the Law in the EU The EU Mobility Directive came into effect earlier this year and aims at creating a set of harmonised rules for cross-border restructuring in the EU in order to minimise roadblocks in the enjoyment of the freedom of establishment codified in Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Even before this directive was operationalised, European courts had been interpreting the freedom under Article 49 broadly to conclude that allowing domestic demergers but barring CBDs would run contrary to the spirit of the article. CBDs were thus viewed as a necessary extension of legalising domestic mergers, and this is a position that the Indian tribunals could have also taken given the spirit of economic freedom embedded in our Constitution. Regardless, the latest directive specifies three channels for CBDs: first, a company may decide to ‘spin off’ an entire line of business to a separate entity while still retaining some business for itself; second, a conglomerate may ‘split up’ the work it does into two different entities, and cease to exist itself; and lastly, a demerged corporation may become the sole shareholder of the resulting entity, thus moulding the latter in the nature of a subsidiary of the former. The importance of this last category is more practical than theoretical. Imagine a situation where a company expands into a new jurisdiction through a mere representative office. Thereafter, if a corporation enjoys great success in this jurisdiction, it can establish a stronger presence there through a CBD by separation in order to effectively create a subsidiary. Despite its attractions, there are several shortcomings in the EU framework which India should take care to avoid. The EU Directive only allows demerging assets to a new corporation and not into an existing entity in order to avoid complexities. Thus, a demerger for the purposes of absorption, i.e., where the acquiring entity is already in existence, is not possible directly. It can be done indirectly by first undertaking a domestic demerger and then a cross-border merger with the existing entity. However, this unnecessarily introduces complexities in the process, which is what the Directive set out to avoid in the first place. Furthermore, the scope of the Directive is such that it restricts the option of CBDs to limited liability corporations only. This is perhaps because corporate restructuring options for other forms of companies are governed by separate rules in the EU. However, in drawing inspiration from this Directive in the Indian context, care must be taken to differentiate on this point and extend the benefit of CBDs to all forms of companies. In doing so, separate procedural rules may be framed for different categories of companies, keeping in mind policy choices to avoid potential misuses of CBDs that the Legislature may foresee. A Blueprint for Cross-Border Demergers in India The need for separate provisions in the Companies Act, 2013 to tackle CBDs cannot be overemphasised. Undeniably, CBDs are attractive tools in order to simplify corporate structures, adapt to the ever-changing market conditions and reap the benefits of new opportunities in the global market. It is important to concede to the criticism that the ultimate end-goal of CBDs can be achieved through other means as well. For instance, let us assume an Italian travel and tourism company ‘A’ wishes to spin-off its tourism line of business to a new Australian corporation ‘B’ established for this purpose, while retaining the travel business for itself. Instead of doing this through a CBD, company ‘A’ could always proceed by first creating a new entity ‘C’ in Italy itself and then transferring all assets relevant to tourism to ‘C’. Thereafter, it could pursue a cross-border merger between ‘C’ and ‘B’. However, this process is unnecessarily time-consuming and highly cost-intensive, further underscoring the need for separate legal provisions for CBDs. Another factor to be considered is that CBDs may be abused in order to carefully divide a corporation’s assets in a manner that puts creditors or employees at a disadvantage. However, isolated instances of abuse should not serve as a basis for denying corporations which comply with the law the attractive opportunity of CBDs. Instead, to tackle concerns of misuse, an appropriate legal framework can be put in place. Having established that separate provisions for CBDs are indeed required, one must now outline what these might look like. The first question to be answered is what types of CBDs should be legalised in India. In the author’s opinion, the three categories in the EU Directive are sufficiently comprehensive and can be transposed in India. These categories can be better understood through the following illustrations:  Split-Up: A company ‘A’ transfers all of its assets and liabilities to more than one entity in exchange for the allocation of equity in the resulting companies (entities ‘B’ and ‘C’ in the below diagram) to the shareholders of ‘A’ i.e., the demerged company.   Figure 1.1: Split-Up  Spin-Off: An entity ‘A’ spins off a part of its assets to one or more corporations in return for equity in these corporations being allotted to the shareholders of ‘A’.   Figure 1.2: Spin-Off  Hive-Down: A company ‘A’ hives down a part of its assets by transferring it to one or more corporations in exchange for equity in these corporations being allotted to ‘A’ directly, and not its shareholders or members.   Figure 1.3: Hive-Down Any provision dealing with CBDs in India should explicitly outline these three options. Additionally, there is a case to be made in favour of not limiting the CBD provisions to restrict demergers for the purposes of absorption as the EU Directive does. The reason is that, as outlined above, the goal sought to be achieved through such demergers can be attained through the combination of a domestic demerger and a cross-border merger, both of which are legal in India, in any case. Thus, to simplify the process, the law would be better placed in recognising such demergers while providing for any limitations required in order to protect the interests of all of the parties’ involved. The proposed provision should also have built-in safeguards in order to avoid any potential abuse of CBD routes. For starters, companies in distress or insolvent companies should not be allowed to avail of the CBD provisions. This is important to ensure that companies do not exploit the CBD mechanism to avoid winding-up or insolvency proceedings as allowing such evasion would adversely affect creditors, the protection of whose rights is increasingly important in light of transition of Indian corporate law towards the stakeholder model. Moreover, the provisions should empower the Registrar of Companies or any other competent authority to disallow the CBD if, upon an examination of the facts of a given restructuring proposal, it is found that the demerger is aimed at unduly evading tax liabilities or prejudicing rights of employees, creditors, or minority shareholders. Care must be taken to outline the grounds for abuse (for instance, tax evasion or avoidance of compliance with labour standards) in clear and specific terms, as broad phrases may lead to the conferral of an overly wide discretionary power upon the competent authority, opening up the doors for arbitrary exercise of power. The CBD provisions should be designed keeping in mind the protection of the interests of minority shareholders, which was one of the key drivers of the 2013 Companies Act. It is suggested that a right to exit be provided to minority shareholders with a guarantee of provision of adequate compensation in any case of CBD. Moreover, specific safeguards should be instilled in cases of disproportionate demergers since these risk the possibility of minority shareholders being ‘squeezed-out’. It is true that the Companies Act through its section 236 recognises the ‘rule of majority’ principle, set outin the case of Foss v. Harbottle [1843] 67 ER 189, according to which minority shareholders have no choice but to be bound by the majority’s decision. However, in cases of such squeezing-out, the Indian corporate law framework requires the payment of the fair value or a higher price for the minority’s equity, as per rule 27 of the Companies (Compromises, Arrangements and Amalgamations) Rules, 2016. This protection should also be applied in the context of those CBDs which lead to the squeezing-out of the minority shareholders. Lastly, care must be taken to clearly delineate the applicable laws in cases of CBDs, considering the jurisdiction of the demerging company may have different procedural and form requirements when compared to the law of the land of the resulting company. In this regard, the EU Mobility Directive presents a creative solution that could potentially be adopted in the Indian case too. The Directive provides for a pre-division certificate to be issued by the competent authority after scrutinising the legality of the application for CBD before it. If found to be for abusive purposes like tax evasion, the CBD can be outrightly denied. However, if the application is indeed legitimate, the certificate may be granted. In the time period before the grant of this certificate, the law of the host state of the demerging company is to apply. Thus, all the procedures and formalities present in the host state’s law must be adhered to right from the drafting of the application to the approval of the pre-division certificate. Thereafter, the application shall be put forth before the competent authority in the resulting company’s country. At this stage, which is after the grant of the pre-conversion certificate, the resulting company’s jurisdictional laws and the procedural requirements therein are to be followed. Thus, the pre-conversion certificate serves as a differentiating boundary which neatly divides and places the entire CBD timeline into the legal frameworks of the different states involved. A similar approach could be followed in India, with a pre-conversion certificate or any other similar instrument serving the purpose of demarcating the applicable laws to avoid potential confusion due to contradictory laws. Conclusion While conflicting orders have clouded the legal position on CBDs in India with a great deal of uncertainty, a broad interpretative approach reveals that such demergers cannot be said to be against the legislative intent of the Parliament. In any case, it would be in the interest of all stakeholders involved to clarify the position through an explicit provision that recognises CBDs and outlines the procedures and safeguards that are associated therewith. In designing this provision, the EU legal framework provides a good roadmap of the dos and don’ts when it comes to regulating CBDs. – Ishika Garg Company Law International Developments Mergers and Acquisitions"

            "Navigating India’s Green Taxonomy: Charting a Course for the Future By GuestMay 2, 20236 Min readAdd comment   [Manvi Khanna is a Research Fellow at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy and Hitoishi Sarkar a fifth-year law student at Gujarat National Law University. This post first appeared as an article in the Deccan Herald] The G20’s Sustainable Finance Working Group’s recent emphasis on the need to establish a green finance ecosystem has brought to the limelight the challenges that impede India’s green finance efforts. A crucial component of a credible green finance ecosystem is a shared understanding of what constitutes ‘green’, attainable through a green taxonomy that aligns with international standards. As India takes on the G20 presidency with climate change as a key agenda item, it has a valuable opportunity to advance global sustainability initiatives by fostering an international consensus on what qualifies as ‘green’. This shared understanding would curb information asymmetry and prevent greenwashing while directing capital towards truly green financial activities. Additionally, it would provide a standardised approach for financial institutions, regulators, companies, investors, and policymakers to identify, develop, and finance green projects, thus facilitating India’s green finance efforts. This post outlines India’s efforts so far in formulating a green taxonomy and offers policymakers insights on charting a future course for India’s green taxonomy. India’s efforts so far in developing a green taxonomy While India’s green taxonomy is still a work in progress, notable strides have been made by financial sector regulators such as the Securities Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’), the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) and the International Financial Services Centres Authority (‘IFSCA’) in promoting green finance. In 2017, SEBI formalised the disclosure requirements for the issuance and listing of green debt securities in its attempt to fillip sustainable finance in India. It defined broad areas where funds may be allocated to qualify a debt security as green, including renewable energy and clean transportation. This was later subsumed into the SEBI (Issue and Listing of Non-Convertible Securities) Regulations, 2021 and the definition expanded this year to include blue bonds, yellow bonds and transition bonds as subcategories of green debt securities. The absence of a green taxonomy regarding assets to be financed through green bonds and the potential harm of greenwashing posed by it was specifically highlighted in the SEBI Consultation Paper on ‘Green and Blue Bonds as a mode of Sustainable Finance’. Additionally, it highlighted the reluctance amongst bankers and lenders in financing green bonds as well as issuers of green bonds due to the lack of domestic green assessment criteria. SEBI has also made attempts to improve sustainability reporting in India. In terms of disclosure requirements, in 2021, SEBI introduced the more comprehensive Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting Framework, which contains principle-wise detailed environmental, social and governance disclosures that apply to the top thousand listed companies, including banking companies. India’s central bank, the RBI, has also echoed the critical need for a green taxonomy. In 2022, it released a Discussion Paper on Climate Risk and Sustainable Finance, providing entities regulated by it with broad guidance on how their governance arrangements, strategies and risk management structures need to be recalibrated to account for climate risks. Tasked with addressing greenwashing concerns without an official green taxonomy, the RBI recently released a Framework for acceptance of Green Deposits which mandates regulated entities to formulate a comprehensive Board-approved policy on green deposits. Interestingly, much like SEBI, the RBI has also stuck with an approach of providing broad categories of activities for which allocation of proceeds raised from green deposits may be utilised until an official green taxonomy is finalised.  As a financial regulator located at GIFT City in Gujarat, the IFSCA also has been actively pursuing its goal to establish itself as a global hub for green finance. In April 2022, it released the Guidance framework on sustainable and sustainability-linked lending by financial institutions, which mandates banking units and financial companies in the IFSC to have a board-approved policy on green and sustainable lending. The framework provides an indicative list of eligible green categories for green lending, providing clarity and direction to the financial institutions at various stages of the life cycle of lending. In October 2022, the IFSC Expert Committee on Sustainable Finance recommended developing an internationally aligned taxonomy to attract foreign investors by exploring existing global taxonomies and developing common ground between the Indian and international green taxonomy. Way Forward From the above, it is clear that although financial sector regulators have made some efforts to define ‘green’, the approach by far has led to fragmentation and lack of standardisation. To remedy this, the Department of Economic Affairs set up a Task Force on Sustainable Finance in 2021, which submitted a draft taxonomy. However, there is limited information available in the public domain on the current status of finalising this taxonomy. India’s G20 presidency presents an opportunity to reinvigorate deliberations for developing a shared understanding of what constitutes ‘green’ and ensuring increased interoperability in the development of a green taxonomy as many countries look to finalise their taxonomies. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (‘ASEAN’) member states’ considerable success in formulating a taxonomy that serves as a common language across the ASEAN jurisdictions to communicate and coordinate on labelling for economic activities and financial instruments can serve as a valuable reference point in this regard. In developing a green taxonomy, policymakers in India could adopt a more pragmatic approach similar to that of the EU taxonomy to mitigate the risk of fragmentation and inconsistency. Rather than waiting for a comprehensive taxonomy to be developed, an ex-ante classification that applies across all financial sectors, complemented with detailed prescriptions for high-risk sectors should be considered. Taxonomies such as those of the EU and South Africa go a step ahead and highlight the need for a technical screening criterion for certain high-risk sectors, such as infrastructure and transport, which take into account the unique factors that affect those sectors. Providing interpretative assistance, such as comprehensive FAQs regarding the taxonomy’s scope and engaging continuously with the industry stakeholders, would be key to incentivising the adoption and the effectiveness of such a taxonomy. Sustainable development relies on timely action and the delay in formulating a green taxonomy puts India at risk of missing out on substantial green capital. Therefore, India must accelerate its green growth across sectors by crafting its own locally sensitive green taxonomy that strikes a delicate balance between its economic goals and environmental responsibilities, without further ado. – Manvi Khanna & Hitoishi Sarkar Financial Markets Sustainability"

            "Cross-Border Merger Framework in India: Limited Efficacy? By GuestApril 27, 202310 Min readAdd comment   [Rajat Sethi (Partner), Sumit Bansal (Partner) and Oshika Nayak (Associate) are at S&R Associates] The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notified section 234 of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended (the “Companies Act”), and rule 25A of the Companies (Compromises, Arrangements and Amalgamations) Rules, 2016, as amended (the “Companies Merger Rules”), on April 13, 2017, to permit merger and amalgamation of a foreign company with and into an Indian company and vice versa. Further, the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) notified the Foreign Exchange Management (Cross Border Merger) Regulations, 2018, as amended (“FEMA Merger Regulations”), on March 20, 2018, to address the gaps in the existing framework from a foreign exchange perspective. Key Provisions under the Companies Act  Prior to 2013, the merger or amalgamation of an Indian company with a foreign company was not permitted under the Companies Act, 1956, as amended (“Erstwhile Act”). The Erstwhile Act defined “transferee company” to only include companies incorporated in India and restricted the scope of cross-border mergers to mergers of foreign companies with and into Indian companies (section 394 of the Companies Act, 1956). However, section 234 of the Companies Act removed this restriction and made Chapter XV (Compromise, Arrangement and Amalgamations) applicable to all cross-border mergers. Accordingly, section 234 of the Companies Act, read with rule 25A of the Companies Merger Rules, provides the framework for cross-border mergers in India. Pursuant to such provisions, the concerned company is required to seek prior approval from the RBI for any merger or amalgamation with a foreign company or Indian company, as applicable, and file an application before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) in accordance with sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act and rule 25A of the Companies Merger Rules. The scheme for merger may provide for payment of consideration to the shareholders of the merging company in cash, depository receipts or partly in cash and depository receipts, and is required to comply with the requirements of sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, including approval from the shareholders, creditors and tax authorities, among others (see section 234(2) of the Companies Act). However, the scope for merger of an Indian company with a foreign company is limited to the jurisdictions identified under the Companies Merger Rules. This includes foreign companies incorporated in the jurisdiction:  whose securities market regulator is a signatory to International Organisation of Securities Commission’s Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (“MoU”) or has a bilateral MoU with the Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”), or whose central bank is a member of the Bank for Internal Settlements, and which has not been identified in the public statement of Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) as: (a) a jurisdiction having a strategic Anti-Money Laundering or Combating the Financing of Terrorism deficiencies to which counter measures apply, or (b) as a jurisdiction that has not made sufficient progress in addressing the deficiencies or has not committed to an action plan developed by the FATF to address the deficiencies. (Annexure B of the Companies Merger Rules).  On May 30, 2022, the MCA notified amendments to rule 25A of the Companies Merger Rules introducing a new requirement for filing Form No. CAA-16 along with the application filed before the NCLT to confirm government approval in case of a merger with a company incorporated in a country sharing land border with India. Key Provisions under the FEMA Merger Regulations The FEMA Merger Regulations (in regulation 2) define cross-border merger to mean “any merger, amalgamation or arrangement between an Indian company and foreign company in accordance with Companies (Compromises, Arrangements and Amalgamation) Rules, 2016 notified under the Companies Act, 2013.” The regulations have further classified cross-border mergers as: (i) inbound mergers- where the resultant company is an Indian company, and (ii) outbound mergers – where the resultant company is a foreign company. Any merger which is undertaken in accordance with the FEMA Merger Regulations will be deemed to have prior approval of the RBI for the purpose of rule 25A of the Companies Merger Rules, provided the following conditions are met (if any of such conditions are not met, prior RBI approval will be required): Transfer of Securities  In case of an inbound merger:  The resultant company may transfer its securities to a person resident outside subject to the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of Security by a Person Resident outside India) Regulations, 2017, as amended (“FEMA 20-R”). With effect from October 17, 2019, the FEMA 20-R stands superseded by the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, the Foreign Exchange Management (Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2019 and Foreign Exchange Management (Mode of Payment and Reporting of Non-Debt Instruments) Regulations, 2019. Accordingly, references in the FEMA Merger Regulations to the FEMA 20-R should now be replaced with the above foreign exchange rules and regulations, as applicable. If such merger involves a foreign company, then additional compliance is required with respect to the Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of any Foreign Security) Regulations, 2004, as amended (“TIFS Regulations”) (see regulation 4(1) of the FEMA Merger Regulations). With effect from August 22, 2022, the TIFS Regulations stand superseded by the Foreign Investment (Overseas Investment) Rules, 2022 (“Overseas Investment Rules”). Accordingly, references in the FEMA Merger Regulations to the TIFS Regulations should now be replaced with the Overseas Investment Rules.  In addition, in case of an outbound merger, a resident individual may acquire or hold securities in the resultant company in accordance with the limits of the Liberalized Remittance Scheme provided under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1992, as amended and regulations issued thereunder (“FEMA”) (see regulations 5(1) and 5(2) of the FEMA Merger Regulations). Branch/Office outside India  Pursuant to an inbound merger, the office of the foreign company would be deemed to be the branch/office of the resultant company outside India under the Foreign Exchange Management (Foreign Currency Account by a Person Resident in India) Regulations, 2015, as amended. Further, pursuant to an outbound merger, the office of the Indian company would be deemed to be the branch office of the resultant company in India under the Foreign Exchange Management (Establishment in India of a Branch Office or a Liaison Office or a Project Office or any other Place of Business) Regulations, 2016, as amended. Typically, the business income of such branch office of the foreign company (derived from its operations in India) would be taxed at 40% plus applicable surcharge and cess. Borrowings and Guarantees   Pursuant to an inbound merger, the borrowings and guarantees of the foreign company from overseas sources vest with the resultant company and such company is required to ensure compliance with the FEMA within a period of two years. No remittance is permitted to be made from India for repayment of the liability during such period and the condition with respect to end use is not applicable. In case of an outbound merger, the outstanding borrowings and guarantees of the Indian company vest with the resultant company and are required to be repaid in accordance with the terms of the scheme sanctioned by the NCLT. The resultant company is not permitted to acquire any INR liability which is payable to a lender in India unless it is compliant with the FEMA and obtains no-objection certification from Indian lenders to that effect.  Acquisition and Transfer of Assets The resultant company may acquire and hold assets outside India or in India, as permitted under the FEMA and transfer it in the manner permitted therein. Any asset or security of the resultant company contravening the FEMA is required to be sold within two years from the sanction of the scheme by NCLT and the sale proceeds are required to be repatriated outside India or to India, as applicable. The resultant company may thereafter use such sale proceeds to repay any existing liability in India or outside India, as applicable.   Bank Accounts  The resultant company pursuant to an inbound merger may maintain an overseas bank account for the transactions relating to the cross-border merger for a maximum period of two years from the sanction of the scheme by the NCLT. In case of an outbound merger, the resultant company may open a Special Non-Resident Rupee Account under the Foreign Exchange Management (Deposit) Regulations, 2016, as amended, for a similar period.  Valuation Valuation of the merging companies is required to be undertaken in accordance with Rule 25A of the Companies Merger Rules. Additionally, for an outbound merger, the valuer is required to be a member of a recognised professional body in such jurisdiction and the valuation is required to follow international accounting and valuation standards. Tax Implications The exemptions under the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“the IT Act”) for tax neutrality of merger are available only if the transferee company is an Indian company. Such exemptions are not available in case of merger of an Indian company with a foreign company. Accordingly, the Indian company and its shareholders could be liable to tax in case of merger of an Indian company with a foreign company. It is also relevant to highlight section 72A of the IT Act which provides for carry forward and set off of accumulated tax business losses and unabsorbed depreciation in case the merger complies with certain specified conditions. In terms of Section 72A, such benefit will not be available in case of outbound mergers. In addition, in case of inbound mergers, tax losses of the foreign company may not qualify as ‘accumulated losses’ under the provisions of IT Act and therefore may lapse. Conclusion The facilitation of outbound mergers under the current legal framework has expanded the scope of cross-border mergers in India. However, as a practical matter, the framework for cross-border mergers in India remains of limited efficacy. Such framework has so far largely been utilized only in the context of merger of foreign wholly owned subsidiaries with and into the Indian holding company[1] or vice versa. [2] This appears to be on account of several reasons, including: (a) the nature of the conditions for deemed RBI approval under the FEMA Merger Regulations (prior RBI approval is required if such conditions are not met), (b) lack of clarity regarding demergers (Section 234 of the Companies Act refers to mergers and amalgamations only instead of compromise and/or arrangement as used in Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act), and (c) absence of tax benefits in relation to outbound mergers that are otherwise available for domestic mergers subject to specified conditions, including absence of a provision for carry forward and set off of accumulated tax business losses and unabsorbed depreciation. – Rajat Sethi, Sumit Bansal & Oshika Nayak   [1] For example, the Scheme of Amalgamation of Bio Energy Venture-1 (Mauritius) Pvt.

            "Denying Input Tax Credit to Bona Fide Recipients Where GST is Not Paid by the Supplier By GuestApril 26, 202311 Min readAdd comment   [Shubham Sharma is a 2nd year BBA LLB (Hons.) law student at Chanakya National Law University] A key distinction between GST and the pre-GST tax regime is that GST promises to eliminate the “cascading effect of taxes” or “tax on tax” that sellers often suffer from. Input tax credit (ITC) under GST is one such core concept that furthers this objective. ITC is the tax that a business pays on a purchase, and when it makes the sale, it can reduce its tax liability. ITC helps businesses reduce their tax liability on purchases by claiming credit to the extent of GST. ITC is the cornerstone of GST and can be claimed regardless of the location of the seller, making sales and purchases of products more accessible. However, section 16 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (“CGST Act”) lists certain requirements that have to be fulfilled by a business in order to claim ITC. One such condition provided in section 16(2)(c) of the CGST Act is that the tax charged in respect of the supply of goods must be actually paid to the government by the supplier. Thus, a claimant would be entitled to ITC only when, inter alia, the tax on supply has been paid to the government. Placing such a burden on the claimant is arbitrary and impractical as it is impossible for a claimant to determine whether or not the supplier has remitted the tax to the government. In case of default, the claimant will not only be denied ITC but also will face the additional burden of furnishing reverse ITC along with interest to the government. Such a provision clearly discriminates between bona fide claimants and fraudulent claimants of ITC. The recent judgment of Madras High Court in Pinstar Automotive India Pvt. Ltd. v. Additional Commissioner (20 March 2023) is an example of the issue. The High Court ruled that the condition laid down in section 16(2)(c) of the CGST Act needs to be interpreted strictly and the mandate is upon the claimant to ensure compliance with the provision, failing which it would not be entitled to ITC. The author argues that the said ruling is problematic and incorrect as it denies the benefit of ITC to bona fide claimants. The author supports his argument by analyzing the said ruling in light of judicial pronouncements on the issue in the pre-GST regime as well GST regime. Facts of the Case In the present case, Pinstar Automotive India Pvt. Ltd (petitioner) was an assessee under the CGST Act and had received a pre-assessment notice from the respondent in regard to the issue relating to the invocation of section 16(2)(c). The petitioner stated that it had received certain supplies from three third parties – Techno Rubber Plastic and Co., Techno Rubber and Plastic, and Unique Autoplastics Private Limited and that it had paid the entirety of the amount including the tax to them. However, it was found that the suppliers had not filed GSTR 3B and no tax was remitted to the department, as a consequence of which the petitioner suffered a reversal of ITC. The petitioner argued that it was entitled to ITC as it had fulfilled all the conditions under the statute and had also adduced proof of the same. However, the stand of the petitioner was rejected unilaterally by the respondent who passed an order confirming the demand proposed in the pre-assessment notice. Aggrieved by this order, the petitioner moved the High Court seeking rectification of errors apparent on the face of the record under section 161 of the CGST Act. Having heard both parties, the Court ruled that the requirements laid down in section 16 of the CGST Act to claim ITC need to be interpreted strictly to ensure that the interests of the revenue are not jeopardized. It observed (at para 9):“The provisions of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 has, assimilating wisdom of experience from the erstwhile tax regimes, gone one step further to ensure that the interests of the revenue are protected by providing for a mandate that the tax liability is defrayed/met either at the hands of the supplier or the purchaser, the petitioner in this case.” Thus, the Court ruled that it was not the department’s fault that the suppliers in the present case failed to remit the tax to the department. Instead, the onus is on the supplier or purchaser to ensure compliance with section 16 without which they would not be entitled to ITC. Analysis of the Issue The heart of the controversy revolves around the interpretation of section 16(2)(c) of the CGST Act, which states that a recipient is eligible for ITC only if the tax levied on the supply of goods has been deposited with the government by the supplier. The bare provision of section 16(2)(c) of the CGST Act reads: “Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, no registered person shall be entitled to the credit of any input tax in respect of any supply of goods or services or both to him unless, –– subject to the provisions of section 41 or section 43A, the tax charged in respect of such supply has been actually paid to the Government, either in cash or through the utilization of input tax credit admissible in respect of the said supply;” [emphasis added] The provision becomes troublesome if the words “has been actually paid to the Government” is interpreted to mean that it is the duty of the recipient to ensure that the tax paid by them on goods supplied by the supplier is actually transferred to the purse of the government by the supplier. This means that an additional burden will be placed on the claimant to cross-check whether the supplier has paid the tax to the government failing which, the claimant would not be entitled to ITC under the law. This risks the position of a bona fide purchaser who is precluded from claiming ITC even when the default occurs on the part of the supplier and not the claimant as is the case in the present matter. It is pertinent to note that this issue is not an alien one and was a highly debated issue even in the pre-GST regime. The jurisprudential position surrounding this issue can be understood from the following judicial decisions. In a significant ruling in 2013, the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Central Excise, Jalandhar v. Kay Kay Industries, while allowing the recipient (respondent) to claim MODVAT credit even when the supplier had defaulted in his duty to pay tax received from the recipient on inputs to the department, held that “an assessee is not expected to verify with Department whether the supplier had paid duty on inputs or not supplied by Manufacturer-Supplier in order to avail deemed MODVAT credit.”  The Court further observed that where the assessee has followed the prescribed procedure, it would be unjustifiable and impractical to impose such a condition and would instead lead to transactions getting delayed. In the same year, the Delhi CESTAT in the case of CC & CCE v. Juhi Alloys Ltd  held: “A buyer can take steps that are in their control and he cannot be expected to verify the records of the supplier’s broker (i.e. dealer) to check whether, in fact, the supplier has paid duty on the goods supplied by him or not. Hence, as long as the bonafide nature of the consignee transaction is not doubted, credit should not be denied to the buyer.” A similar view was taken by the Jharkhand High Court in Commissioner of C. Ex., East Singhbhum v. Tata Motors Ltd., and by a Division Bench of Himachal Pradesh High Court in A.B. Tools Limited v. Commissioner of Central Excise. Further, the ruling of Delhi High Court in Arise India Ltd. v. Commissioner of Tax is relevant to the discussion at hand. The issue involved in the case was a clause in the Delhi Value Added Tax Act (“DVAT Act”), section 9(2)(g), which is identical to section 16(2)(c) of the CGST Act. Section 9(2)(g) of the DVAT Act states:  (2) No tax credit shall be allowed – … (g) to the dealers or class of dealers unless the tax paid by the purchasing dealer has actually been deposited by the selling dealer with the Government or has been lawfully adjusted against output tax liability and correctly reflected in the return filed for the respective tax period.” The High Court, while striking down the above provision, observed that the DVAT Act does not create an intelligible distinction between bona fide purchasing dealers vis-à-vis fraudulent dealers which renders this provision invalid in terms of Article 14 of the Constitution. The Court was of view that such a provision casts an undue responsibility on the purchaser to verify whether the tax is paid by the seller to the government and also denies ITC to a purchaser even if the transaction is bona fide. Further, the Court said that in case the seller fails to deposit the tax, the authorities should move against the seller first and not the buyer for recovery of tax. This ruling was later upheld by the Supreme Court as well. Coming to the new GST regime, one can observe a similar set of judicial decisions. For instance, the Madras High Court in M/s D.Y. Beathel Enterprises v. the State Tax Officer, the Court while allowing the recipient to claim ITC observed that strict action must be taken against a seller who due to omission on his part fails to remit the tax paid by the recipient. Similarly, in  Assistant Commissioner (CT), presently Thiruverkadu Assessment Circle, Kolathur, Chennai v. Infiniti Wholesale Ltd., the Madras High Court held that where the purchaser has proved that it has paid the due tax to the seller and furnishes the invoices for the same, it cannot be stopped from availing the ITC. The Court added that such a restriction on claiming ITC cannot be sustained and requires re-consideration. Thus, from a plain reading of the above rulings of various High Courts in the pre-GST as well as GST regime, it can be inferred that the courts have ruled in favour of bona fide purchasers and allowed them to avail ITC even when their supplier had defaulted in remitting the tax to the kitty of the government. The courts took cognizance of the actions of authorities denying ITC to businesses where the seller has not deposited the tax and declared such conditions in the law as unfair, arbitrary, and inimical to business interests. The courts have clearly noted that it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the buyer of supplies to go and verify the supplier’s accounts or to inquire with the department whether the tax paid by them on the inputs has been collected or not. On the issue of reversal of ITC and recovery of dues from buyers, it is useful to refer to the Press Release issued by the Central Board of GST Council dated 4 May 2018 which clearly stated that in case where the supplier defaults in payment of tax, there shall not be any automatic reversal of input tax credit to the buyer unless an exceptional case can be made out. Instead, the recovery shall be made from the supplier first. The Government’s intention behind ITC has further clarified in the 28th GST Council Meeting  where it recommended that recovery of unpaid tax be done from the defaulting supplier. Thus, in the present case, the petitioner was wrongfully denied ITC and instead charged with reversal of ITC and interest for no fault on its part. Way Forward  It is ostensible that section 16(2)(c) of CGST Act 2017 in its present form is susceptible to an interpretation that imposes a duty on the recipient to crosscheck whether GST has been remitted by the supplier to the government for the invoice on which ITC has been collected from the recipient. However, under the current GST mechanism, it is an uphill task for businesses to determine whether or not the supplier has filed the tax to the government. This places businesses in a precarious situation where they are expected to determine whether the intentions of the suppliers are opportune or not. Adding to the woes of the businesses is the provision of reversal of ITC along with interest which clearly goes against the spirit of GST to facilitate ease of doing of businesses in the nation. Hence, it is imperative that the government seriously reconsider the above provisions and bring about a corresponding amendment in the GST law to eradicate the hardship faced by the recipients in claiming ITC. Further, there should be a mechanism set up to track payment by supplier against a particular invoice to avoid any undue hardships on recipients. Until then, it is expected that the judiciary take steps to ensure that ITC is not denied to bona fide purchasers. – Shubham Sharma GST Taxation"

            "Interpretation of DTAAs: A Special Case of Explicitly Applying Vienna Convention for Treaty Interpretation By GuestApril 20, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Shantanu Singh is a 4th year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) student at Dharmashastra National Law University, Jabalpur] In India, international treaties are not immediately incorporated into domestic law. Under the “dualism” approach, separate legislation is necessary for India to execute treaty-based international law. Treaties, according to Indian courts, are part of public international law and thus are open to interpretation in conformity with international law principles. They have also acknowledged, to varying degrees, that the relevant principles for interpreting international agreements are contained in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”). Insofar as India is not a signatory to VCLT, the adoption of articles 31-33 of treaty interpretation can be viewed as the application of customary international law. The International Court of Justice and investment tribunals have consistently regarded these articles as representing customary international law. Likewise, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed that VCLT embodies customary international law principles in the case of Ram Jethmalani v. Union of India. The Supreme Court has observed that the principles contained in articles 31-33 are widely recognized as reflecting customary international law on the interpretation of treaties and “provide a broad guideline as to what could be an appropriate manner of interpreting a treaty in the Indian context also.” India differs from other non-parties, such as the US, in its reluctance to explicitly reference VCLT for treaty interpretation. Substantive international law, like foreign law, is invoked where it is perceived to be supportive of constitutional rights. The courts have embraced the practice of seeing treaties as external aids to interpreting domestic law under article 51 jurisprudence. Conventions and treaties have been used as external aid in the interpretation of national legislation by Indian courts wherever possible. Domestic adjudication has made extensive use of substantive international law, although reference to international principles of treaty interpretation has been relegated to one area – the interpretation of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (“DTAAs”). Interpretation of Tax Treaties: A ‘lex specialis’ Isolated from the Rest VCLT is most explicitly introduced in the sphere of tax law in India. In DTAA cases, courts embrace articles 31 and 32, rather than disputing VCLT’s application. The Supreme Court decided in Azadi Bachao, a case involving treaty shopping and the India-Mauritius Tax Treaty, that: “…the principles adopted in interpretation of treaties are not the same as those in interpretation of a statutory legislation. An important principle which needs to be kept in mind in the interpretation of the provisions of an international treaty, including one for double taxation relief is that treaties are negotiated and entered into at a political level and have several considerations as their bases.” Articles 31 and 32 of VCLT appear to provide a broad framework for interpretation in the context of tax treaties. First, as stated in article 31 of VCLT, “A tax treaty is to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning given to the treaty in the context and in the light of its objects and purpose.” Second, in accordance with article 31(1), a tax treaty must be “interpreted as a whole,” which the courts have interpreted to mean that the treaty’s provisions must be read in harmony with one another. As with VCLT, there are exceptions to the general rule regarding ordinary meaning. These include, analogous to article 32(b), a rule allowing deviation from the plain meaning of the language where the context necessitates it. This allows for the avoidance of absurdities and promotes the interpretation of the treaty “ut res magis valeat quam pereat, i.e., to make it workable rather than redundant.” Third, where the basic purpose of the treaty may be compromised in relation to particular issues under consideration, a literal or formal interpretation must be avoided. Last but not least, if a tax treaty uses a term but does not define it and if the context of the treaty warrants it, the term may be assigned a meaning that is different from what it would mean under domestic law. Recourse to Model Commentaries The terms of the Commentaries can also be considered supplementary means of interpretation under article 32. However, it is important to note that such recourse is only available to confirm an interpretation that has already been reached by the court using the rules outlined in article 31, or in cases where the application of these rules leaves the meaning of the treaty obscure. The treaties signed by India are neither entirely based on the UN model nor the OECD model. When it comes to tax treaties, India takes a two-pronged strategy. Certain provisions of Indian tax treaties are based on the OECD model language, while others are adopted from the UN model. VCLT provides a common minimum interpretative canon in this mixed situation where resorting to international meaning is nevertheless desirable. India is an OECD observer and uses a hybrid model based on the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital or the United Nations Model Convention, as well as the commentaries that accompany them that illustrate and interpret the provisions of the models. Towards Adopting the Precept of Common Interpretation in India DTAAs refer to agreements between two countries that aim to prevent the double taxation of non-residents. The main objective of these agreements is to ensure that individuals or entities that generate income in a foreign country are not taxed twice, i.e., in their country of origin and in the country where the income was generated. By signing a DTAA, two countries agree to provide relief from double taxation by allowing either a tax credit or an exemption. This helps to promote cross-border trade and investment by removing barriers to the movement of capital and people between countries. Additionally, DTAAs allocate tax claims equally between contracting states, which is not possible with unilateral interpretations. Klaus Vogel proposed the method of ‘common interpretation’ in 1986 for interpreting DTAAs. The method suggests that treaties should be interpreted consistently by both countries to ensure the success of DTAAs. It is based on article 31(1) of VCLT, which requires DTAAs to be interpreted in light of their objects and purpose. By adopting a ‘common interpretation’ approach, DTAAs can be applied uniformly, promoting their effectiveness. The availability of tax treaty benefits based on the most favored nation (“MFN”) clause has been a recurring matter of litigation in India. In Concentrix Services Netherlands B.V. vs. Income Tax Officer TDS (2021), the Delhi High Court had an opportunity to interpret the MFN clause of the tax treaty between India and the Netherlands (“the tax treaty”). The MFN clause in the tax treaty stipulates that if India enters into a treaty with an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) member country that provides for a more limited scope or a lower rate of taxation with regard to certain items of income such as dividends, interest, and others, the beneficial provisions would then apply to the tax treaty as well. The Dutch taxpayer company attempted to utilize the MFN clause to apply a lower rate of tax for dividends earned from its Indian subsidiary, citing the Indian tax treaties with Slovenia, Lithuania, and Colombia. However, the Revenue Department of India opposed the taxpayer company’s attempt, stating that the MFN clause did not apply in this situation. The Department noted that while the aforementioned countries are currently OECD member states, they were not members of the OECD when the relevant Indian tax treaties were signed. The Court had to decide if the MFN clause of the tax treaty applies to a treaty made by India with a third country that later became an OECD member. By adopting the ‘common interpretation’ approach, the Court sided with the taxpayer, stating that the MFN clause should be observed at the time of application of the tax treaty and not when it was entered into with the third country. The Court based its decision on the intent of the other treaty partner i.e., a decree issued by the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which was deemed the best interpretative tool. This approach reflects the fundamental assumption underlying article 31(1) of VCLT which stresses the importance of interpreting treaties in a manner that establishes the common intention of the treaty parties. The ruling by the Delhi High Court is a significant milestone in the interpretation of the MFN clause in tax treaties and marks a pioneering decision in India. The judgment sheds light on the nuanced application of the ‘common interpretation’ principle and the appropriate timing for evaluating the OECD status of the other country. Until further clarification or a contradictory ruling on the matter, this verdict should serve as a precedent. Conclusion The article sheds light on the adoption of ‘common interpretation’ by Indian Courts in DTAA matters. It explains that the foundation of this doctrine is rooted in Article 31(1) of VCLT, which requires DTAAs to be interpreted in light of their objects and purpose. Moreover, it highlights that although the Indian courts have made efforts to reconcile domestic laws with substantive international law through article 51 of the Constitution, the application of VCLT in treaty interpretation is primarily confined to cross-border tax matters in India. By harmonizing the interpretation of VCLT rules, the Indian judiciary could establish a counterpart to the harmonization of domestic and international law. To achieve this, the Supreme Court could look towards cross-border tax matters as a reference point and incorporate them into their mainstream (non-tax) jurisprudence. – Shantanu Singh Taxation"

            "“Private Placement”: Syntactic Interpretation of a Financing Engagement Letter By Umakanth VarottilApril 19, 20236 Min read2 comments   Recently, the England and Wales High Court (Commercial Court) had the occasion in Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. v. Yes Bank Limited [2023] EWHC 745 (Comm) (31 March 2023) to consider contractual language in capital market transactions. While the contract itself was governed by English law, the ruling has implications on contractual interpretation more generally, in addition to its relevance to India, as the subject matter of the contract related to the follow-on public offering (FPO) of Yes Bank Limited. The dispute arose out of an engagement letter under which Cantor Fitzgerald undertook to advise Yes Bank in finding suitable investors to enable the bank to raise further capital. After the parties executed the letter, the original transactions by which the capital raising was to occur were shelved. Subsequently, under a new management, Yes Bank proceeded with the FPO where, among others, three investors originally identified by Cantor also subscribed to shares worth total of INR 27.93 billion. Cantor was not part of the investment banking team for the FPO, nor did it possess a SEBI-registered merchant banking licence to be able to do so. At stake, therefore, was the legal question of whether Cantor was entitled to fees under the engagement letter for the capital contribution made by these investors in the FPO. The High Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Bright, was primarily concerned with the specific language of the engagement letter, which read: “[Cantor] have been advised by [Yes Bank] that it contemplates one or more financing(s) through the private placement, offering or other sale of equity instruments in any form, including, without limitation, preferred or common equity, or instruments convertible into preferred or common equity or other related forms of interests or capital of [Yes Bank] in one or a series of transactions (a “Financing”).” In particular, the specific question was “whether the adjective “private” qualifies only the word immediately following, “placement”, or whether it also qualifies the terms that come next, i.e., “offering” and “other sale of equity instruments …”. If the qualifier “private” extends to all the ensuing terms, then a public offering such as an FPO is not covered with in the scope of Cantor’s engagement, thereby disentitling it to fees. On the other hand, if the expression “private” were to extend only to the term “placements” and not to “offering” and “other sale of equity instruments”, then Cantor is very well eligible to the fees. Although the term “private placement” is a term of art and legislatively incorporated under Indian law in the Companies Act, 2013 and various regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the Court decided to eschew the specifics and rather ascribe a broader generic interpretation to the relevant clause in the engagement letter. Mr. Justice Bright observed (at paragraphs 86 to 89): “Where an adjective or determiner is followed by a series of nouns in a list, the conventional understanding is that it modifies all the nouns in that list (unless a discordant adjective or determiner breaks the pattern). This is not an abstruse rule or pattern known only to specialist grammarians. It is familiar to people in general; or, as it may more appropriately be put in order to illustrate the point: to every Tom, Dick and Harry. It is certainly widely observed and followed by lawyers. Both in practice and as a tribunal, I have frequently come across the formula “… negligent act or omission” and sometimes “negligent act, error or omission”. I do not think it has ever occurred to me or to anyone else involved that the word “negligent” might arguably be said only to modify “act”. Above all, this way of using and understanding words was undoubtedly familiar to the parties to the Engagement Letter. … Accordingly, as a matter of the ordinary meaning of the words, “private” in the first sentence of clause 1 modifies “offering” and “other sale of equity instruments”. It follows that the defined term “Financing” only relates to private placements, private offerings and private sales. It does not extend to an FPO. This is necessarily a provisional view, because it is also necessary to consider the first sentence of clause 1 in the context of the contract as a whole and against the background of the overall context, including the factual matrix and broader considerations of business common sense. I do this under the series of headings that follow.” In assessing the context, the Court examined the various types of securities offerings permissible under Indian law. While some types of offerings, such as preferential offerings and qualified institutional placements (QIPs) are private placements, other types such as public offerings (whether initial or follow-on) and rights offerings are not within the scope of private placements. Hence, judging by the context, the Court found that “the surrounding circumstances make it unlikely that the parties intended Cantor to be involved in an FPO. They are more consistent with the word “private” modifying not only “placement” but also “offering” and “other sale”. This decision raises concerns regarding possible ambiguities in contract drafting that make it more difficult for courts to discern the intention of the parties. Ultimately, much depends upon both the grammatical as well as contractual construction of the ambiguous clauses, which might have the effect of creating uncertainty for the parties. While the broad outcome of the decision is understandable, it has not been devoid of criticism. From a pure drafting perspective, one way to address the issue and enhance specificity would be to delineate the coverage of the engagement letter more optimally by splitting it into separate transaction forms. Admittedly, this exercise is with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. In the first instance (Illustration 1), if the clause were to read “(i) private placement, (ii) offering or (ii) other sale of equity instruments in any form”, Cantor’s fee would clearly have become payable. On the other hand (Illustration 2), if the clause read “(i) private placement, (ii) private offering or (iii) other private sale of equity instruments in any form”, the outcome would have been the same as in this case. There is some amount of awkwardness in the manner of drafting in Illustration 2, which leaves the question of whether the parties to the Cantor/Yes Bank dispute indeed intended the outcome generated in Illustration 1.

            "Preserving the IBC’s rationale: The Tussle with the Benami Act By GuestApril 16, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Rohan Srivastava and Rupam Dubey are currently B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) students at the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru]  Presently, the Supreme Court is considering an appeal in the C Ramasubramaniam Liquidator v. Deputy Commssioner of Income Tax (Benami Prohibition) , which will potentially establish the extent to which the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (‘IBC’), [year] is given precedence over other civil proceedings. The controversial NCLAT order in question in the aforesaid case has already been followed in the recent M/s Senthil Papers and Boards case on March 13, [year] and could further weaken the overriding nature of the IBC. At the center of the issue is a conflict between the government’s authority to seize property under the Benami Transactions Act. [year] (‘Benami Act’) and the need to maintain a company as a “going concern” during the CIRP moratorium. This article argues that the NCLAT decision has the effect of undoing the IBC’s overriding nature, and that there is a lot at stake if the Supreme Court fails to overturn it. The Clash At the heart of the issue lies the clash between two non-obstante clauses in  Section 238 of the IBC and Section 67 of the Benami Act. While clashes with other legislations is not new in the IBC’s nascent yet dynamic history, there have been no authoritative pronouncements by any court on whether the Benami Act will override the IBC. The appellant in the given case, was undergoing CIRP. The IBC was enacted in 2016 to bring about a major shift in Indian insolvency law by moving from a debtor in control regime to a creditor in control regime for the insolvency process in order to maximize value of the debtor’s assets and allow for speedy recoveries. In order to effectuate this change, the IBC contains a moratorium provision in Section 14, as per which no legal proceedings, amongst other things, can be initiated against the corporate debtor’s property during the CIRP. This is to ensure that the corporate debtor’s assets are preserved during the entire CIRP, and the creditors’ interest is not harmed. Section 238 of the IBC further cements this by holding that the IBC shall have an overriding effect over anything inconsistent contained in any other law in force. In the case at hand, the moratorium was initiated from 15.10.2018. The said period was extended for 90 days on 17.10.2019. It was during the subsistence of this moratorium period that the appellant received a provisional attachment order under the Benami Act on 01.11.2018 which is being challenged in the given appeal. The Benami Act, enacted in 1988, was enacted with the objective to prohibit benami transactions and ensure the right to recover property held benami. To achieve this end, Section 24(3)  provides the power to an initiating officer to “attach” a property, thereby prohibiting transfer of the said property. To allow for this to operate, the Benami Act also includes section 67 which is a non-obstante clause similar to section 238 of the IBC. It was under Section 24(3) itself that the impugned provisional attachment order was issued restraining transfer of the said property. This said attachment interfered with the resolution process as it would force the company to be liquidated as had happened in the given case. The NCLAT, Chennai, refused to set aside the provisional attachment order and held that the NCLAT was not competent to adjudicate on the issue, it being one that relates to the Benami Act was thus liable to adjudication only by the competent authority in the Benami Act. In doing so, the tribunal acquiesced to the overriding effect of the Benami Act over the IBC. It further cemented its stance by drawing from the cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and noting that, like in PMLA cases, under Benami Act as well, the victim is the ‘state’, reflecting the recent judicial trend of giving leeway to the government at the cost of IBC’s economic efficiency. Decoding the Conflict of IBC with PMLA Given the reliance placed by the NCLAT on judgements dealing with the clash between PMLA and the IBC, it becomes pertinent to evaluate the same. In Deputy Director Directorate of Enforcement v Axis Bank, the Delhi High Court dealt with the clash between the PMLA and the IBC. The High Court observed that section 8(5) of the PMLA allows the Central Government to confiscate properties that stem from the “proceeds of crime,” while the IBC deals with civil proceedings and has a non-obstante clause regarding civil proceedings. The court concluded that the proceedings under the PMLA are criminal in nature because the confiscation is related to the proceeds of a crime, and therefore, both proceedings are independent of each other and can continue  simultaneously. Similarly, in the case of Rajiv Chakraborty Resolution v Directorate of Enforcement, the Delhi High Court held that the government’s confiscation of assets under the PMLA is not for the purpose of recovering debt as creditors. Rather, it is to impose a restraint on the property holder’s right. The court added that the moratorium provision under the IBC aims to maximize the value of the corporate debtor’s assets, both being distinct objectives that can operate in their own field. However, it would be an error to claim that the same considerations will also apply in cases dealing with the clash between the Benami Act and the IBC. Firstly, to resolve the inconsistency between the Benami Act and the IBC, it is necessary to consider the nature of the proceedings each one entails, as was done in Axis Bank. The attachment of property under section 5 of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, [year] is done to deprive a person of their beneficial interest in the property. This can be seen in section 19 of the aforesaid act, which lays down that the power of the authorities is similar to those with courts under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Hence, the confiscation under Benami [Act?] and the proceedings thereafter are civil and not criminal in nature. Despite the fact that entering into a benami transaction is made an offense under the [which act?] Act, the clash is not with the offense at hand but with the ‘attachment’ power and the latter is clearly a civil proceeding that will be overridden by section 63 of the IBC. The Supreme Court in Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal v State of Bihar also held that that confiscation of property is a civil, rather than punitive, measure. Similarly, Section 40(5) of the Benami Act states that proceedings before the Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be civil court proceedings. Secondly, there have also been cases dealing with the clash between PMLA and the IBC where the importance of the moratorium and objectives of the IBC have been upheld over the PMLA. In SREI Infrastructure Finance Ltd. v. Sterling SEZ and Infrastructure Ltd., the tribunal [NCLAT?]  held that the attachment initiated after the moratorium cannot be held as valid [Why? – please include a supporting reason]. Hence, instead of treating the jurisprudence on PMLA clashes as settled, the court has to evaluate the case at hand on its own merits to see if the IBC would prevail or not. Resolving the Conundrum  In Solitaire India Pvt Ltd v Fairgrowth Services, the Supreme Court ruled that when two special statutes have non-obstante clauses and the proceedings under them are of the same nature, the latter act should override the former. The Supreme Court reasoned that since the legislature was aware of the existence of the non-obstante clause in the former act and still passed the latter act with a non-obstante clause, the latter act should take precedence. Applying this reasoning to the facts at hand, it follows  that the Benami Act should give way to the IBC, the latter being a later enactment. Having established that Section 238 [of what?] would have precedence over Section 67 [of what?], it is clear that the attachment is non est in law. Firstly, as already noted, since both the moratorium and attachment are civil in nature, section 63 of the IBC which debars the jurisdiction of ‘any other civil court’ or authority will thus oust the Benami Act and the adjudicating authority provided therein. As stated in Section 40(5) of the Benami Act, all proceedings before the appellate authority will be civil proceedings. Hence, the NCLAT was wrong in holding that the said attachment can only be reverted by the authority under the Benami Act, as the same directly affects the operation of the moratorium and is overridden by Section 63 of the IBC. Secondly, an attachment order as in the given case, makes it impossible for a resolution applicant to revive the corporate debtor. The rule of harmonious construction as elucidated in Busching Schmitz Private Ltd vs P.T. Menghani that “legislative futility is to be ruled out as long as interpretative possibility permits” will have to be considered by the courts in resolving the inconsistency. Applying this principle, the twin goals of value maximization and timely resolution both are at stake if an attachment order is allowed to derail the CIRP. As held in SREI Infrastructure, delayed proceedings can frustrate the objective of the time-bound process of the IBC and may also lead to erosion in the value of the assets. This will affect both the corporate debtors and the creditors who are two crucial stakeholders in the insolvency process.Moreover , the Benami Act allows for an attachment order to be served at the personal satisfaction of the initiating officer, the same being a very low threshold with the potential of exploitation. This could derail the CIRP on a mere suspicion of a benami transaction. On the other hand,  the government will still be able to obtain its dues if the CIRP is allowed to continue. After the case of Rainbow Papers, it has been settled that statutory dues have to be met before the debt of any creditor is discharged. Hence, the anxiety that was present in most PMLA cases, that ‘proceeds of crime’ will be allowed to discharge the corporate debtor’s civil liabilities, no longer exists post the Rainbow Papers verdict. Conclusion  The Supreme Court’s decision in C Ramasubramaniam can potentially set a troublesome precedent if the NCLAT verdict is not overturned. Allowing the Benami Act proceedings to prevail over the IBC will practically undo sections 238 and section 63 by preventing the IBC from overriding civil proceedings despite the express wordings of the two sections. This will open the doors to frustration of the IBC’s economic rationale which has so far been praised for inculcating investor confidence and promoting asset maximization. – Rohan Srivastava & Rupam Dubey Insolvency Interpretation of statutes"

            "Unraveling “Materiality” in SEBI’s Consultation Paper: Legal Perspectives and Recommendations By GuestApril 14, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Shantanu Dhingra is a 3rd year law student at the National Law University Odisha] The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on 20 February 2023 released a consultation paper focused on streamlining disclosures by listed entities, intending to strengthen compliance with the SEBI Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations, 2015. Central to this post is the notion of materiality, which plays a crucial role in determining the nature and scope of information that listed entities must disclose to the market and investors. This post explores the legal complexities surrounding materiality in SEBI’s consultation paper and provides insights into refining the material event determination process. Through a critical analysis of relevant case law and a comparative study of international practices, this post aims to present innovative legal approaches and best practices that can inform India’s materiality determination process. Dissecting SEBI’s Materiality Framework The SEBI consultation paper proposes a materiality framework that encompasses both quantitative and qualitative factors, aiming to provide clearer guidance for listed entities in determining material events for disclosure. The proposed framework delineates criteria such as financial implications, strategic consequences, and reputational risks, which together form the basis for assessing materiality. However, the framework also introduces interpretative ambiguities and divergent applications, potentially leading to inconsistencies in disclosure practices across the industry. A primary challenge within the proposed framework is the absence of a clear threshold demarcating financial materiality. The lack of explicit guidance can result in subjectivity and discretion in evaluating an event’s significance. For instance, the Satyam Computer Services accounting scandaldemonstrates the implications of ambiguous financial materiality guidelines, as insufficient disclosures led to a significant erosion of investor confidence and market integrity. Furthermore, qualitative factors such as strategic importance and reputational risks are inherently subjective and may pose challenges in quantification. This subjectivity frequently results in divergent interpretations of materiality. The Kingfisher Airlines crisis serves as a case in point, where inadequate disclosures about the company’s financial health and strategic decisions contributed to substantial losses for investors. In addition to the challenges posed by the proposed framework, relevant case law provides valuable insights for refining the materiality determination process. The Infosys whistleblower case underscores the importance of clearly defining materiality, as the lack of timely and transparent disclosures related to the allegations resulted in significant stock price fluctuations and reputational damage. This case emphasizes the need for a well-defined materiality framework that considers both financial and non-financial factors. Similarly, the Tata-Mistry dispute highlights the importance of incorporating qualitative factors such as corporate governance and stakeholder relations into the materiality determination process. Inadequate disclosures regarding corporate governance issues in this case led to concerns over transparency and raised questions about the company’s commitment to shareholder interests. In conclusion, examining the challenges and relevant case law relating to SEBI’s proposed materiality framework provides valuable insights for refining the framework to address ambiguities and inconsistencies in disclosure practices. By incorporating both quantitative and qualitative factors and learnings from past experience, the materiality framework can be improved to better protect investor interests and maintain market integrity. Gleaning Insights from Global Materiality Practices The US model, with its “total mix of information” standard, places significant weight on the reasonable investor’s perspective. This approach has merit in terms of ensuring that materiality is assessed from the viewpoint of the intended audience, i.e., the investor. However, it may not fully capture the complexity of an ever-evolving market landscape, especially in terms of non-financial factors such as ESG considerations. To address this limitation, the Indian context could benefit from incorporating an adaptable framework that considers both financial and non-financial factors in materiality determination. On the other hand, the EU’s principles-based approach provides flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions but may suffer from ambiguities and inconsistencies in its application. To mitigate this drawback, SEBI could explore establishing clearer guidance or minimum standards that listed entities must adhere to while maintaining the flexibility offered by the principles-based approach. In synthesizing insights from the US and EU models, it is crucial to create a hybrid approach that is well-suited to the Indian market’s unique characteristics. This tailored approach should blend the strengths of both models, incorporating the reasonable investor perspective and the principles-based approach, while addressing their respective limitations. Such an approach would help develop a more robust and effective material event determination process that resonates with the central argument of the post. Furthermore, it is essential to emphasize the importance of learning from global best practices and adapting them to the Indian context, rather than merely replicating them. By critically analyzing and understanding the underlying rationale of these practices, SEBI can create a materiality framework that not only aligns with international standards but also addresses the specific challenges faced by the Indian market. In conclusion, deepening the analysis of global materiality practices and maintaining a professional tone allows us to better address the central argument of the post. By examining the US and EU models, identifying their strengths and weaknesses, and proposing a tailored approach for the Indian context, we contribute to the ongoing discourse on refining the material event determination process to balance transparency, corporate interests, and investor protection. Rethinking Materiality: A Normative Proposal To address the challenges in SEBI’s proposed materiality framework and provide a more in-depth critical analysis, the following recommendations suggest creative legal arguments and solutions that surpass the existing framework and SEBI’s suggestions in its consultation paper. Relevant case law has been incorporated to demonstrate the potential benefits of these recommendations. 1. Adopting a dual-threshold approach for financial materiality: SEBI should consider a dual-threshold approach, wherein both absolute and relative thresholds are used to determine financial materiality. This approach could include a percentage of a listed entity’s total assets, revenues, or market capitalization, as illustrated in the US SEC’s Regulations S-K. Additionally, it could include an absolute threshold, such as a specific monetary value, to ensure that even smaller events with significant financial implications are captured. This dual-threshold approach would reduce ambiguity and subjectivity in materiality determination, leading to a more consistent application across various sectors and listed entities. For instance, a company experiencing a substantial drop in revenues due to supply chain disruptions might trigger the relative threshold. Simultaneously, a smaller company suffering a significant loss due to a single event, such as a legal settlement, might trigger the absolute threshold. A potential challenge to this approach is the difficulty in determining the appropriate thresholds for various sectors and company sizes. SEBI could address this by engaging in extensive consultations with market participants and analyzing industry-specific data to establish suitable thresholds. In the Satyam Computer Services accounting scandal, a dual-threshold approach might have prompted earlier and more transparent disclosures, potentially averting the erosion of investor confidence and market integrity. 2. Introducing a risk-based tiered materiality disclosure system: SEBI could implement a risk-based tiered materiality disclosure system, inspired by the EU’s Market Abuse Regulation (MAR). This system would consider the potential risk posed by material events to investors and the market as a whole, triggering different reporting obligations based on the assessed risk level. This approach would help prioritize disclosures, ensuring that the most crucial information reaches investors without overwhelming them with excessive details. In the Kingfisher Airlines crisis, a risk-based tiered disclosure system might have led to more accurate and timely disclosures of the company’s financial health and strategic decisions, potentially minimizing investor losses. 3. Integrating qualitative factors and ESG considerations: SEBI should incorporate qualitative factors and ESG considerations into the materiality assessment process. This comprehensive approach would involve assessing the potential impact of an event on a company’s reputation, relationships with stakeholders, strategic direction, and sustainability performance. This integration would capture the multifaceted nature of materiality, ensuring that all relevant factors are considered and that disclosures align with global trends in investor priorities. The Tata-Mistry dispute highlights the importance of incorporating qualitative factors such as corporate governance and stakeholder relations, as inadequate disclosures regarding these issues raised concerns over transparency and the company’s commitment to shareholder interests. 4. Developing a principles-based materiality assessment framework: SEBI could benefit from a principles-based framework that provides guidance on materiality assessment while allowing for adaptability to evolving market conditions and specific circumstances. This framework should emphasize transparency, accountability, and stakeholder engagement, promoting a disclosure culture that focuses on the quality and relevance of information provided to investors. The Infosys whistleblower case underscores the importance of a principles-based framework that considers both financial and non-financial factors, as the lack of timely and transparent disclosures related to the allegations resulted in significant stock price fluctuations and reputational damage. 5. Fostering cross-border regulatory collaboration: Finally, SEBI could explore opportunities for collaboration with other regulatory bodies, both domestic and international, to develop a harmonized approach to materiality determination. Drawing lessons from the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and its principles on disclosure, this would not only enhance consistency across jurisdictions but also facilitate cross-border cooperation in addressing emerging legal challenges in the disclosure landscape. By adopting a collaborative and informed approach, SEBI can foster a robust and effective materiality framework that balances transparency, corporate interests, and investor protection. Conclusion In conclusion, this post has examined the complexities surrounding materiality in SEBI’s consultation paper and provided insights and recommendations for refining the material event determination process. By learning from relevant case law and international best practices, and incorporating innovative legal solutions such as a dual-threshold approach, risk-based tiered disclosure system, qualitative factors integration, and fostering cross-border regulatory collaboration, SEBI can create a more robust and effective materiality framework. Addressing the materiality conundrum is vital to strike the right balance between transparency, corporate interests, and investor protection, ultimately contributing to a more transparent, accountable, and resilient financial market in India. – Shantanu Dhingra Disclosure Requirements International Developments SEBI Securities Regulation"

            "Liability of Authorized Signatory of a Company to Pay Interim Compensation Under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 By GuestApril 3, 202310 Min readAdd comment   [Khush Bhachawat is a III year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) student at NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad] The Bombay High Court (“HC”) recently held that authorised signatory of a company who signs a cheque on its behalf is not a ‘drawer’ of the cheque and hence is not liable to pay interim compensation under section 143A of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (“NI Act”) in a case of dishonour of cheque. The issue stems from contradictory observations made by two judgments of the Supreme Court (“SC”) and a lack of authoritative ruling on the matter. This post seeks to analyse the judgment of the Bombay HC which reads the contradictory observations of the SC harmoniously and attempts to provide clarity on the issue. The author discusses the liability of a company and its authorized signatories for dishonour of cheque, enquires into whether the signatory is a ‘drawer’ under the NI Act, and whether the signatory can be compelled to pay interim compensation for a default committed by the company. The author concludes by highlighting the importance of a company’s separate legal personality and treating the company as a distinct accused from its agents/representatives. Liability of a Company and its Authorized Signatories for Dishonour of Cheque  Liability for dishonour of cheque when the offence is committed by a company is governed by section 141. A bare perusal of the section reveals that the company and every person who, when the offence was committed, was in charge of and was responsible to the company for the conduct of its business shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence. The primary liability is on the company and the person in charge of and responsible to the company is vicariously liable for such default by way of a deeming fiction. This Section is a departure from the general rule in criminal law against vicarious liability. Sub-section (2) of section 141 says that if the offence is committed with the consent or connivance, or neglect on the part of director, manager, secretary or other officer of the company, such person shall also be deemed to be guilty of the offence. In SMS Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Neeta Bhalla, the SC interpreted section 141 and observed that a director of a company who was not in charge of or responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time, will not be liable unless the conditions under sub-section (2) are met. The Court held that a signatory of a dishonoured cheque is covered under sub-section (2) and no special averment about consent, connivance, or negligence would be necessary to make him liable. This is a settled proposition of law and has been reaffirmed by the SC in cases like K.K. Ahuja v. V.K. Vora, National Small Industries Corporation Ltd. v. Harmeet Singh Paintal, amongst others. Whether the Authorized Signatory is a ‘Drawer’ of the Cheque The genesis of the controversy lies in two seemingly contradictory observations of the SC in Aneeta Hada v. Godfather Travels and Tours Pvt. Ltd. decided by a three-judge bench and a subsequent division bench decision in N. Harihara Krishnan v. J. Thomas. In Aneeta Hada, the Court was tasked to determine whether a complaint under section 138 read with section 141 of the NI Act was maintainable against a director or authorised signatory of a company without arraigning the company as an accused. The Court answered the question in the negative. In para 20 of the judgment, it made the following observation raising doubts on what seemed to be a settled proposition: “20.     Section 7 of the Act defines “drawer” to mean the maker of a bill of exchange or a cheque. An authorised signatory of a company becomes a drawer as he has been authorised to do so in respect of the account maintained by the company.” Relying on this observation, the Respondents before the Bombay HC argued that the reference to ‘drawer’ of the cheque in sections 138, 141 and 143A must also necessarily include the authorized signatory of the cheque. In N. Harihara, the Court was disposed with a similar issue as to whether prosecution against the signatory could be successfully maintained without prosecuting the company. The Court relied on para 59 of the judgment in Aneeta Hada and answered this question in the negative. Since the liability of the director (who was the authorized signatory) was only vicarious, he could not be called a drawer and could not be prosecuted without prosecuting the company. In paragraph 21 of the judgment, the Court held that “every person signing a cheque on behalf of a company on whose account a cheque is drawn does not become the drawer of the cheque. Such a signatory is only a person duly authorised to sign the cheque on behalf of the company/drawer of the cheque.” Prima facie, this observation is contrary to the observation made in para 20 of Aneeta Hada. Curiously, while the Court in N. Harihara relied on Aneeta Hada, para 20 of the said judgment (which makes a contrary observation) was not discussed. In the present case, the Bombay HC relied on N. Harihara and held that a person who signs a cheque on behalf of the company does not become the drawer. The Court rightly pointed that para 20 of Aneeta Hada constituted neither ratio nor obiter but was a mere stray observation. The question of whether an authorized signatory is a drawer never arose before the Court in Aneeta Hada and was not even argued. The Court only held that a company is a principal offender, and its authorized signatory is only vicariously liable under section 141(2). The Bombay HC interpreted para 20 in light of para 19 of the judgment which emphasizes on the person drawing a cheque ‘on the account maintained by him.’ Reading both the paragraphs together, a drawer would be the person who draws a cheque on an account maintained by him. In cases involving companies, the account from which the cheque is issued is in the name of the company and therefore the authorized signatory could not be a drawer. Can the Authorized Signatory be Directed to Pay Interim Compensation Under section 143A of the Act? Section 143A was introduced by way of the Negotiable Instruments Act (Amendment) Act, 2018. It empowers the Court to order the drawer to pay interim compensation of not more than 20% of the amount of the cheque to the complainant pending the dispute. Further, section 148 empowers the Appellate Court to order payment of a minimum of 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial Court pending appeal against conviction. This amount is in addition to the interim compensation payable under section 143A. In the present case, the Respondents contended that sections 143A and 148 should be purposively interpreted to allow Courts to direct an authorized signatory to pay interim compensation. Such a reading was sought to be justified by the deeming fiction under section 141. It was argued that under section 138, the Court had the discretion to impose a fine on the defaulting company. Considering the effect of section 141(2), the authorized signatory could also be held jointly liable for such fine. If the authorized signatory could be held liable under section 141(2) to pay the final relief of a fine imposed on a company under section 138, interim compensation being an interim relief in aid of the final relief, could also be imposed on such authorized signatory. The Court rejected this contention on two grounds. Firstly, the liability for the punishment of persons specified in section 141(2) is triggered only after it is ‘proved’ that offence has been committed with their consent, connivance, or negligence. Interim compensation is usually awarded at the stage of recording of plea by the Magistrate. However, no evidence can be led to prove these factors at this stage and their liability cannot be established. Here, the idea of company’s separate legal personality also assumes significance. Directors serve as agents of companies and are not personally liable for their actions. A director can be held personally liable only if he acts beyond his powers, breaches his fiduciary duty, or commits fraud. The onus is on the drawer company to prove its innocence and lead evidence establishing a breach of fiduciary duty or an instance of fraud. However, an enquiry in this regard is not contemplated by section 143A and is not possible at the stage of interim compensation. Such an enquiry would frustrate the purpose of granting immediate interim compensation and cause delay in disposal of cases. Secondly, section 141 does not contain any specific provision allowing the Court to direct persons other than drawer to pay interim compensation. Section 143A deals with the payment of interim compensation and confers specific power on Courts to direct only drawers and no one else to pay the amount.  The Court referred to the statement of objects and reasons of the 2018 Amendment as well as the Lok Sabha debates to infer the intention of the legislature. The word ‘drawer’ in section 143A has a clear and unambiguous meaning. As per the settled rule of interpretation, where “the language of a provision is plain and unambiguous and capable of only one meaning, there is no question of the construction of a statute, as the provision speaks for itself.” By fastening the liability only on the drawer, the legislature intended to exclude anyone else from being made liable to pay interim compensation. The Court also addressed the Respondent’s apprehension about the consequences of not holding an authorized signatory to be a drawer vis-a-vis sections 14 and 96 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”) dealing with moratorium periods. It was argued that if the authorized signatory could not be directed to pay interim compensation, then the complainant would be rendered remediless as no claims could be made against the company undergoing Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (“CIRP”). The Court pointed that section 143A was introduced after IBC and it can be assumed that the legislature was aware that companies undergoing CIRP could not be directed to pay interim compensation because of the moratorium period. Despite this, it chose to not include persons other than drawers under the ambit of section 143A thus giving further clarity on the correct interpretation of the provision. Conclusion While cases under the NI Act largely deal with matters of criminal procedure, this case clarifies that authorized signatories cannot be directed to pay interim compensation for a default committed by the company. The Bombay HC highlights the importance of the separate legal personality of a company and treats the company as a distinct accused from its agents/representatives. The Court also observed that under section 148 of the Act, order for deposit of minimum 20% of the fine/compensation can only be made against drawers (here, the company). In an appeal against conviction filed by persons other than drawer (here, its agents/representatives), depositing such a minimum sum is not necessary. However, the Appellate Court can direct deposit of the amount under section 389 of the Code of Criminal Procedure while considering the application for suspension of conviction or sentence. It must be noted that recently, the Delhi HC and the Kerala HC have also taken similar views holding that an authorized signatory does not become a drawer of the cheque. However, neither of these High Courts were dealing with the specific question of interim compensation. Although the Bombay High Court harmoniously interprets the contradictory observations made in Aneeta Hada and N. Harihara, a decisive ruling by the SC would put this issue to rest. – Khush Bhachawat Corporate Criminal Liability Directors Interpretation of statutes Negotiable Instruments Act"

            "Promissory Estoppel Revisited: Comment on State of Jharkhand v. Brahmputra Metallics Ltd. By GuestMarch 30, 20236 Min readAdd comment   [Kaustav Saha is a Lecturer at Jindal Global Law School. His research interests include private law and legal theory.] The doctrine of promissory estoppel has had a somewhat unprincipled evolution in Indian law, particularly in its relation to the doctrine of consideration and, more pertinently to this post, in its role and character as a public law remedy. In this context, the case of State of Jharkhand v. Brahmputra Metallics Ltd., Ranchi raises important questions regarding the doctrine’s applicability in a certain class of cases. While a substantial portion of the judgement attempts to articulate the foundations of the doctrine of legitimate expectation in contrast to promissory estoppel, this post focuses on why promissory estoppel is not appropriately applied to non-contractual cases involving the government or public bodies.  Facts and Decision The State of Jharkhand notified the Jharkhand Industrial Policy, 2012 (“Policy”), on 16 June 2012. Clause 32.10 of the Policy provided an exemption from the payment of 50% of the electricity duty for a period of five years for captive power plants established for self-consumption or captive use. Clause 38(b) of the Policy provided that notifications enforcing the terms of the Policy would be issued within one month by the Departments of the State Government. Such notifications were legally necessary to give effect to the exemption in terms of the Bihar Electricity Duty Act 1948. However, contrary to the Policy, no notification was issued until 8 January 2015—and when issued, it only operated prospectively. The effect of the delay in issuing the notification, and making its operation prospective, was to deprive the respondent of the exemption from electricity duty for a substantial period that it would have been entitled to, had the notification been issued within the stipulated period of one month. In challenging the prospective nature of the notification before the Jharkhand High Court, the respondent placed reliance on the doctrine of promissory estoppel, contending that the grant of exemption with prospective effect was contrary to the representation of the State Government made in the Policy.  The High Court accepted this contention, noting that by virtue of the Policy, a promise was made by the State Government to grant the exemption for a period of five years. Despite clearly intending to grant the exemption, the State did so belatedly, effectively depriving the respondent and similarly placing industrial units of the full period of exemption. In these circumstances, it would be unconscionable for the government to not fulfil its promise. Particular reliance was placed on Manuelsons Hotels Private Limited v. State of Kerala, which, in turn, was based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel as articulated in Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P. While the Supreme Court upheld the High Court’s decision, it did so by relying on the doctrine of legitimate expectation as opposed to promissory estoppel, and the significance of the case lies in this choice. On the Issue of Promissory Estoppel Having noted that promissory estoppel developed in English common law as an equitable remedy, and its limited nature as a defence instead of a separate cause of action, the Court referred to the observations in Motilal Padampat, which gave a more expansive interpretation to the doctrine in India. The Court then went on to discuss the distinct nature of the doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation. It observed that the doctrine of legitimate expectation evolved as a distinct public law remedy in English law, with a wider scope of application as compared to the doctrine of promissory estoppel. In particular, legitimate expectation constituted a cause of action, which did not require a promise but encompassed official practice. The claimant did not have to show that detriment was suffered in reliance upon the official representation. Perhaps the most pertinent observation in distinguishing the two doctrines is that “while the basis of the doctrine of promissory estoppel in private law is a promise made between two parties, the basis of the doctrine of legitimate expectation in public law is premised on the principles of fairness and non-arbitrariness surrounding the conduct of public authorities”. This distinction assumes particular importance given that in most similar cases between the government and a private party, it is difficult to find a “promise” made by the government, without artificially stretching the meaning of that word. The facts of Motilal Padampat itself illustrate this. The case concerned a claim for exemption of sales tax on the appellant’s industrial unit, pursuant to a series of communications between the appellant and the government of Uttar Pradesh, through which the government assured the appellant that it would be entitled to the exemption. Contrary to its initial assurances, the government reneged on its representations, which the appellant challenged. It is submitted that even a series of communications addressed by the government to a specific party assuring that a benefit will be conferred cannot be construed as a “promise” in the natural sense of the term. This is primarily because it is difficult to conceive of the government intending to enter into a contractual obligation to exercise its statutory powers in a certain manner. Moreover, promissory estoppel, historically a contract law doctrine, ordinarily operates to ensure the exercise of a contractual right by supplementing the lack of consideration which would otherwise be an essential element of a contractual claim. However, it would be artificial to construe an entitlement to exemption from taxes or duties as a contractual right. The artificiality of this construction is even more starkly illustrated in the facts of Brahmputra Metallics, where the challenge is based on the issuance of a notification and no specific written communication to the party raising the challenge. Interestingly, in Jit Ram Shiv Kumar v. State of Haryana, which was decided shortly after Motilal Padampat, the Court disapproved of its earlier observations in Motilal Padampat regarding the need for an activist approach to the question of promissory estoppel. Specifically, it observed that regardless of how expansive an approach courts in the USA have taken to the doctrine of consideration (a comparative analysis that played a significant role in Bhagwati J’s analysis in Motilal Padampat), Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act must be read strictly when it makes consideration an essential element of a contract. This indicates that some authority exists for not unduly expanding the scope of the doctrine of promissory estoppel in the context of the government and public bodies. On the other hand, it is unclear why concepts such as unconscionability, unfairness, or arbitrariness should be used to expand the scope of promissory estoppel when, as the Court rightly notes, the doctrine of legitimate expectation directly addresses the issue of public bodies acting contrary to their representations. In this regard, the Court’s detailed articulation of legitimate expectation as a more principled basis to challenge arbitrary government action is a welcome departure and hopefully signals the beginning of the end of stretching promissory estoppel beyond its natural contours. – Kaustav Saha Contract Law"

        "title": "Analyzing Directors’ Duty of Care under the Companies Act, 2013",
        "read_on_content": [
            "Analyzing Directors’ Duty of Care under the Companies Act, 2013 By GuestMarch 29, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Rishabh Mohnot is a lawyer working in Mumbai and Hrithik Merchant a law student at the National Law School of India University, Bangalore] With the increasing proliferation of companies and their influence, there is a growing need to understand the responsibilities vested on their decision-makers. The Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) places a duty of care on the key decision-makers in a company, being the directors, in section 166(3). However, there are considerable lacunae in this provision, which results in a lack of clarity in corporate governance.   In this background, the goal of our paper “§166(3) of the Companies Act, 2013: Filling the Gaps of an Incomplete Provision” is to answer two questions: first, who is the duty of care owed to; and second, what is the standard for such duty? The right-holder of the duty of care Section 166(2) of the 2013 Act stipulates that the director’s duty of good faith is to consider the interests of all stakeholders, such as shareholders, employees, the community, and the environment. Contrarily, section 166(3) is silent on who the duty of care is owed to. There are three broad approaches to the question of right-holders: first, the duty is owed to all stakeholders; second, the duty is owed solely to the company and the directors have discretion in assuming this duty towards other stakeholders; and third, the enlightened shareholder value (“ESV”) approach introduced in the UK Companies Act, 2006 (“UK Act”), which states that the duty is owed only to the company but the interests of the stakeholders must be accounted for while making managerial decisions. We argue that the second approach is cogent in context of section 166(3) for four reasons. First, the mention of stakeholders in section 166(2) and not in section 166(3) reflects the legislative intent to include stakeholders only for the purposes of section 166(2). Second, given the silence of the provision, we must look at the previous regime, i.e., the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”). Under the previous law, the duty of care was solely owed to the company. Third, the duty of care in India arises due to the trust placed by the company on its directors. There is no such relationship between the directors and other stakeholders. This is in contrast to the UK approach, where Parliamentary discussions explicitly state that the duty of care is not a fiduciary one. Fourth, the duty of care, contrary to what some academicians have argued, is not sub-set of the duty of good faith. The distinct exposition of the two duties clearly highlights their nuances, without one being subsumed by the other. Further, we argue that even normatively, it is not desirable to read in the ESV approach into section 166(3). The ESV approach attempts to form a middle-ground between the shareholder and stakeholder approach. However, in our opinion, it does little to amend the existing shareholder approach since the duty of care is ultimately owed to the company. Stakeholders cannot bring an actionable claim against directors for not taking their interests into account. One may argue that ESV approach leads to long-term improvement of the stakeholder interest. However, the relationship between long-termism and stakeholder welfare is indeterminate. Long-term decisions, such as cutting down on salary costs, may not necessarily be in the interests of the stakeholders. Thus, we believe that the shareholder value is not only the legally sound approach to the duty of care, but also the desirable one. The standard of care Upon our analysis of the Indian jurisprudence, we find a lack of consistent standard applied by the Indian courts for the duty of care under the 1956 Act. The Rajinder Sachar Committee, set up to make recommendations to the 1956 Act, stated that the standard of care is that of a reasonable man. However, there was no discussion on the same. Even when the Indian courts have asserted that they will apply an objective standard, they have often reasoned their decisions based on the subjective circumstances of the director. At this juncture, it is crucial to delineate the different approaches for the standard of care. The subjective standard, previously followed in common law, requires the director to act in accordance with her skill and experience. However, the UK shifted to a combination of the subjective and objective standards in their Companies Act 2006. This is embodied in section 174(2)(a), which places a minimum threshold of “general knowledge, skill and experience” reasonably expected of a person carrying out the functions of a director and can be only be raised based on the general knowledge, skill and experience the director already possesses. The subjective-objective test also finds itself in the business judgement rule of the US and the agency law of India. In the former, there is a presumption that a director is acting in good faith that the actions are furthering the best interests of the company. Any reasonable justification would meet this threshold. The duty of care will only be breached in case of proven bad faith, fraud, or gross negligence. This, in our opinion, is an extremely low threshold since proving bad faith or gross negligence is an onerous burden for the shareholders. The US approach is founded on the principle that barring conflict of interest, the directors are best suited to account for the interests of the company and should be given leeway. We disagree with this approach since even directors acting in good faith should be mandated to adhere to protocol and procedure. The business judgement rule places an unreasonable trust on the directors without having accountability. The Indian Contracts Act, 1872 lays down the principle of agency in India. Section 212 requires agents to conduct their business in accordance with industry practice (objective element), unless the principal is aware of the agent’s lack of skill (subjective element). Notably, this should be distinguished from the UK standard of care, which can only be increased based on the specific skills of the director. We propose that the tort law objective standard of “reasonable man” should be imported to section 166(3). Often invoked in suits of negligence, the reasonable man standard requires placing a proxy – a reasonable person, guided by considerations that ordinarily regulate human affairs – in the shoes of the director. Since this is an objective test, it does not require the courts to delve into the mind of the director in question to conclude whether the actions of the director were to best of their abilities or in the best interests of the company. The guiding principle in our standard is proportionality of the procedure followed to the risk at hand. For instance, if a company has a factory treating hazardous substances, the director would be required to ensure higher safety protocols at that factory. The feasibility of a reasonable man standard raises two questions. First, with reference to whom should the magnitude of risk be measured? Since the corresponding right-holder of the duty of care is the company, the risk evaluated should be with respect to the company. Second, can the reasonable man standard be imported in a corporate governance set-up? We answer this in the affirmative. The 2013 Act lays down the procedure to be followed in different scenarios. These include a list of scenarios where ordinary resolutions of shareholders, special resolutions of shareholders, and simple majority of the board are required. We believe that it is possible to implant the proposed standard on company directors. We propose that when directors make decisions, they should answer two questions: first, what is the possible outcome of the decision; and second, what is probability of the outcome occurring. Based on these considerations, the directors should adopt the requisite procedures. We argue that the reasonable man standard is more suitable compared to the standards previously discussed. First, the reasonable man standard only inquires the decision-making process, and not the substance of the decision itself. Second, running a company is a risky undertaking and hence a standard of care should be based on the proportion of the risk at hand. Having a standard of care based on substance of the decisions or the subjective circumstances of a director would essentially result in a scenario where every decision is challenged by a disagreeing shareholder. This would stifle the directors’ autonomy and company interests. We submit that director decisions should not held to standard-based on outcomes. It would place an unreasonable standard on the directors and inhibit unconventional management styles. The standard we propose is evenly placed between an abysmally low business judgement rule and an onerous subjective-objective standard of UK Act. The standard we propose gives considerable room for directors’ discretion but at the same time, makes the directors accountable for the procedure they follow. Conclusion To conclude, the duty of care provided in section 166(3) of the 2013 Act leaves two questions: the right-holder of the duty and the standard of the duty of care. We argue that legally and normatively, the company is the right-holder. Further, in the absence of specified standard, the reasonable man standard of tort law is best suited to section 166(3). – Rishabh Mohnot & Hrithik Merchant Companies Act Company Law Directors"

            "How Will Courts Decide in Bond Holders versus Central Banks? By Bhargavi ZaveriMarch 23, 20236 Min readAdd comment   [Bhargavi Zaveri Shah a doctoral researcher at the Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore and an editor of IndiaCorpLaw Blog and Harsh Vardhan is a management consultant] The Supreme Court is currently hearing an appeal against a Bombay High Court judgement on Yes Bank’s restructuring plan. The question at hand in this appeal is this: whether, as part of Yes Bank’s restructuring exercise, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-appointed administrator could have written off Yes Bank’s additional tier  bonds without first writing down its equity shares. In other words, could the RBI-appointed administrator have preferred Yes Bank’s equity shareholders over its bond holders. In the meanwhile, half way across the world, a similar write-off has been done by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) in Credit Suisse’s rescue plan. Under the UBS-Credit Suisse merger deal facilitated by the Swiss central bank, holders of Credit Suisse’s additional tier bonds will get nothing, while shareholders will receive $3.23 billion. As in India, Credit Suisse’s bond holders are reportedly considering legally challenging this decision of the SNB. Financial supervisory authorities in the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU) have issued statements reassuring the public that they would not resort to such prioritization in their own jurisdictions (here and here). The developments in the Credit Suisse case, therefore, have implications for the manner in which the Supreme Court and the litigants themselves might look at the Yes Bank challenge. A key principle of corporate finance is that in the event of liquidation, equity shareholders will be paid out after all other claims against the company have been paid out. While no such prioritization rules apply in rescue or restructuring events, it is widely understood that equity shareholders are the first bearers of losses. This is as true of a small-sized manufacturing company as it is of global banks such as Credit Suisse and the Silicon Valley Bank. In the case of banks, the capital structure, largely dictated by the Basel Norms, is as follows: common equity tier (CET1), additional tier 1 (AT1) and tier 2 capital (T2).  Both AT1 and T2 capital is issued in the form of bonds that earn interest for the investor.  In the event of large losses, it is generally understood that the pecking order of bearing the losses would be – equity first, followed by AT1, and then T2 bonds.  Banking regulations in most jurisdictions demand that banks maintain a minimum level of total capital based on the size of their loans and investments (generally called risk weighted assets). Additionally, they prescribe the maximum capital that can be held in the form of bonds, that is, AT1 and T2 bonds and the minimum that must be brought in as CET1.  While investing in these bonds, investors bear this pecking order of loss absorption in mind and appropriately price these bonds. Thus, AT1 bonds generally carry higher interest than T2 bonds.  Capital, composed of these three tiers, acts like a buffer protecting the depositors from losses that the bank may make say, due to non-repayment of the money that they lend out. It acts exactly like air bags in a car protecting the passengers from getting harmed in the event of an accident. The SNB’s write off of Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds without completely writing off the equity shares upended this well understood loss absorption hierarchy. When the Swiss central bank decided to write off AT1 bondholders, while making a pay-out to its equity shareholders, the Bank of England issued a statement titled “UK creditor hierarchy” re-emphasizing this order of priority, as follows: “[A]T1 instruments rank ahead of CET1 and behind T2 in the hierarchy. Holders of such instruments should expect to be exposed to losses in resolution or insolvency in the order of their positions in this hierarchy.” Similarly, bank supervisory and resolution authorities in the EU, namely, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Single Resolution Board (SRB) and the European Banking Authority issued a joint statement as follows: “[T]he resolution framework…after the Great Financial Crisis has established, among others, the order according to which shareholders and creditors of a troubled bank should bear losses. In particular, common equity instruments are the first ones to absorb losses, and only after their full use would Additional Tier 1 be required to be written down. This approach has been consistently applied in past cases and will continue to guide the actions of the SRB and ECB banking supervision in crisis interventions.” What do these statements mean for the Yes Bank challenge before the Supreme Court? While statements issued by foreign supervisory authorities are obviously not meant to bind authorities or courts elsewhere, the signalling value of these statements is tremendous. These statements re-emphasize the basic tenets of corporate finance and the fact that the decision taken by the SNB and the RBI, of prioritising equity shareholders over bond holders, is an aberration that they do not intend to follow in their own bank resolution processes. At the least, these statements emphasize the need to convey clarity on the manner in which different instruments in banks’ capital structure will rank in the event of a bank failure. That is, what should an investor expect when she buys a bond or an equity share of a bank. The Bombay High Court had the opportunity to provide this clarity when the AT1 bond holders of Yes Bank, who were wiped out by the RBI, challenged the RBI’s decision. In January 2023, when the High Court ruled in favour of Yes Bank’s AT1 bond holders, we had argued that the Bombay High Court had correctly decided in favour of the bondholders. However, the judgement did not serve to provide the clarity on the loss absorption waterfall. We argued that the Court had erred by grounding its decision in technicalities, and that it ought to have looked into the fairness of the RBI administrator’s decision. A reasoned determination of this issue was critical for the banking industry. The recent developments in the Credit Suisse case and the statements on creditor hierarchy issued by supervisory and resolution authorities reinforce our arguments on the need to look into this question on merits.  The lack of clarity on this important issue would make this source of capital expensive for banks. – Bhargavi Zaveri Shah & Harsh Vardhan Banking Corporate Bonds Debt Restructuring International Developments RBI"

            "Breaking the Rules: When Crowdfunding Platforms Cross the Line in Raising Capital By GuestMarch 16, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Mohammad Kaif is a penultimate year student at Campus Law Centre, Faculty of Law, University of Delhi] Crowdfunding has become increasingly popular as a way to raise funds, where numerous individuals invest in a project or a company, usually via an internet-based platform. Some companies have used crowdfunding platforms to issue securities in violation of the provisions of Private Placement, regulated by section 42 of the Companies Act 2013. This post analyses a recent order by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) regarding the use of Tyke, a crowdfunding platform, for raising funds through the issuance of Compulsorily Convertible Debentures (CCDs). Tyke’s Services Tyke is a platform that provides various services to companies, including facilitation towards raising capital transactions and access to its community of member companies. The company must go through KYC verification and diligence on its business model before executing a service agreement with Tyke. Tyke charges an on-boarding fee and a service fee on the amount transferred in the escrow account by community members. Tyke also allows companies to showcase their business through “Ask Me Anything” sessions accessible to its community members, who can communicate their investment intentions and park their investment amount in their virtual escrow account. Tyke supports the setup of the company’s escrow account, third-party KYC verification and private placement compliances. Upon compliance with private placement requirements, the proposed investment amount is remitted to the company’s separate bank account, and securities are allotted to each investor. Tyke charges a service fee calculated as a percentage of the amount raised from investors, ranging from 1% to 4%. Case Analysis The MCA order dealt with two companies, Anbronica Technologies and Relate Communication, that used a crowdfunding platform called Tyke to issue CCDs. The MCA noted that the website of Tyke was used by the company as a media/marketing/distribution channel/agent to inform the public at large about the issue of securities and Tyke collected its fees/commission at various stages from the company. The MCA observed that this use was in violation of section 42(7) of the Companies Act, 2013, which prohibits companies from using media or marketing channels to inform the public about the issuance of securities. The companies submitted that they had only availed the value-added services provided by Tyke, which included the facilitation of connecting like-minded people and investing after the KYC verification people who showed interest in the company. The company connected with persons who showed interest in their business on Tyke and were charged a fee for its services. However, the order noted that Tyke also provided end-to-end services for raising investments through its portal, including onboarding services and charging a commission/fee at the time the amount was deposited by the investor in the virtual escrow account of the company. The MCA noted that section 42 of the Act provides that private placement shall be made to a select group of persons who have been identified by the Board, and the number of such persons cannot exceed 200. The process of private placement covers the offer, invitation to subscribe, or issue of securities to a select group of persons by a company (other than by way of public offer) through private placement offer-cum-application, which satisfies the conditions specified in the section. The provision requires the company to adhere to the limit of 200 persons not only with respect to the number of persons who ultimately subscribe to the securities of the company, but also the said number, i.e., 200, cannot be exceeded at the time of making an offer or invitation to offer of the securities of the company. The company and its promoters/directors were penalized by the MCA for violating section 42(7) of the Act by using the Tyke platform as a marketing and distribution channel for issuing securities. However, despite facilitating the company’s violation, Tyke could not be penalized by the MCA due to the provisions of section 42 of the Act. Issues Raised by the MCA Order The MCA order highlights several issues related to the use of crowdfunding platforms for private placements: Use of third-party platforms for private placement offers Section 42 of the Act allows private placement offers to be made to a select group of persons, but the use of third-party platforms for such offers raises questions about the identity and eligibility of the investors. Companies must ensure that they comply with the provisions of Section 42 while using crowdfunding platforms for private placements. Definition of public advertisement under the Companies Act The order raises questions about the definition of public advertisement and the use of online platforms for private placements. It is unclear whether the use of a third-party platform like Tyke constitutes public advertisement, which is prohibited under the Act. Over-subscription of CCDs and its implications The MCA order noted that Tyke’s platform was not restricted to only 200 members, contrary to what was claimed by the company, and that the number of members who showed interest in the company might exceed 200. This raises concerns about the over-subscription of CCDs and the implications for companies that exceed the limit of 200 investors. Ensuring Compliance when Using Crowdfunding Platforms Companies must ensure that they comply with the provisions of section 42 while using crowdfunding platforms to raise funds. To ensure compliance, companies can take the following steps: Conduct proper due diligence on the crowdfunding platform Companies should conduct a thorough due diligence on the crowdfunding platform before using it to raise funds. This includes verifying the platform’s registration status, checking for any regulatory actions or penalties imposed on the platform, and reviewing the platform’s terms and conditions. Adhere to the limit of 200 investors Companies must ensure that the number of investors who participate in the private placement does not exceed 200. This includes the number of investors who ultimately subscribe to the securities of the company as well as the number of investors who are invited to subscribe to the securities. Avoid public advertisement Companies should avoid using crowdfunding platforms as a media/marketing/distribution channel/agent to inform the public at large about the issue of securities. This includes avoiding any pitch-related information that is accessible to the public without a login. Use only value-added services Companies should use crowdfunding platforms only for value-added services, such as facilitating connections with like-minded investors and conducting KYC verification. Companies should avoid using crowdfunding platforms for end-to-end services that involve the distribution of securities or the collection of funds. Regulations for Crowdfunding Platforms in India In India, crowdfunding takes many forms including equity-based crowdfunding, debt-based crowdfunding, fund-based crowdfunding, and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. Equity based crowdfunding has been banned in India due to multiple scams such as the Sahara scam and the Webwork Trade Links scam, which resulted in significant losses for investors. Fund-based crowdfunding is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) under the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012. These regulations mandate that crowdfunding platforms be registered with SEBI as Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) and outlines the conditions and necessities that such platforms must abide by, which includes the eligibility criteria for investors and the maximum limits of investment. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued directions for P2P lending platforms in India which requires that such platforms must be registered with the RBI as NBFCs and comply with regulations related to capital adequacy, borrower and investor protection, and reporting requirements. Furthermore, adherence to specific regulations by the RBI might be necessary for  crowdfunding platforms including those pertaining to payment gateways, foreign exchange transactions and anti-money laundering measures.   Therefore, companies can ensure compliance when using crowdfunding platforms by ensuring that the crowdfunding platform they use is registered with SEBI and follows the guidelines issued by SEBI and RBI. Companies should also ensure that they comply with the requirements of SEBI’s regulations on private placement of securities under section 42 of the Companies Act 2013. The Way Forward The use of a third-party platform like Tyke to facilitate private placement offers may not be illegal per se, but it is essential to comply with the compliance requirements laid down by the MCA to avoid legal action against the company. The MCA order makes it clear that companies cannot use crowdfunding platforms to issue securities in violation of Section 42 of the Companies Act. Companies should conduct proper due diligence on crowdfunding platforms, limit the number of investors to 200, and avoid public advertisement or using end-to-end services that involve the distribution of securities or collection of funds. They should also limit their use of crowdfunding platforms to value-added services only. Crowdfunding platforms should be mindful of their responsibility in the fundraising process and make certain that they are not enabling any unlawful activities. They need to foster strong relationships with the companies to ensure that all regulatory obligations are met and to provide value-added services that are compliant with legal and regulatory frameworks. Additionally, the government needs to provide clear guidelines on the use of crowdfunding platforms for private placements, and these guidelines should address the definition of public advertisement and over-subscription of securities. Overall, while crowdfunding platforms offer an innovative way for companies to raise funds, compliance with regulations is crucial to avoid legal penalties and protect the interests of investors. – Mohammad Kaif Companies Act Corporate Bonds"

            "Dilemma Surrounding Assignment of Not Readily Realisable Assets (‘NRRA’) under the IBC By GuestMarch 13, 202313 Min read1 comment   [Rohit Sharma is a Partner at Mamta Binani & Associates, Mumbai] By way of a notification dated 13 November 2020, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (‘IBBI’) inserted regulation 37A to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016 (‘Liquidation Process Regulations’), which states as follows: “37A.  Assignment of not readily realisable assets.  A liquidator may assign or transfer a not readily realisable asset through a transparent process, in consultation with the stakeholders’ consultation committee in accordance with regulation 31A, for a consideration to any person, who is eligible to submit a resolution plan for insolvency resolution of the corporate debtor.   Explanation. — For the purposes of this sub-regulation, “not readily realisable asset” means any asset included in the liquidation estate which could not be sold through available options and includes contingent or disputed assets and assets underlying proceedings for preferential, undervalued, extortionate credit and fraudulent transactions referred to in sections 43 to 51 and section 66 of the Code.” Pursuant to the aforesaid amendment, the liquidator can choose to assign a not readily realizable asset (‘NRRA’) to any person who is not ineligible under section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (‘Code’). One of the purposes of the said amendment is the fact that the monumental time taken by the liquidator to dissolve a corporate debtor owing to the pendency of any litigation in a corporate debtor can be reduced. According to the report of the CARE Ratings dated 20 February 2023 (as on December, 2022), 1,901 matters have ended in liquidation, out of which around 50% of the cases (950 cases) are pending for more than two years, while 25% of the cases (475 cases) are pending for more than a year. In many cases, assets of a corporate debtor are disposed of by the liquidator or there is no asset and the liquidator is in a position to distribute the proceeds from liquidating the assets pursuant to section 53 of the Code. However, owing to any pending litigation in the matter of a corporate debtor, the liquidator is unable to file an application for dissolution before the adjudicating authority which ultimately leads to wastage of time while waiting for that specific litigation to be resolved. One example of such litigation could be applications filed under sections 43 or 66 of the Code for preferential or fraudulent transactions conducted by the erstwhile director or promoter of the corporate debtor, as these applications generally take a lot of time for their adjudication, before which the liquidator cannot proceed with filing the dissolution application. With the said amendment, the liquidator may, with the consultation of the stakeholder’s consultation committee (‘SCC’), call for a bid from the public at large for assigning the said asset (including any litigation associated with it) to a third person and straight away file for dissolution of the corporate debtor if all the compliances pursuant to the Code are dealt with. Needless to say, the said assignment brings along with it several challenges that the liquidator faces. The first relates to obtaining the approval of the SCC for assignment of NRRA, and the second to laying down a procedure for the progress of the said assignment after the dissolution of the corporate debtor. The author attempts to deliberate on the prima facie issues with such assignment of NRRA, along with its impact.   Challenges under the Methodology of NRRA The following challenges arise at the time of the planning stage to assign a debt through NRRA. Voting on the highest bidder for NRRA  One important aspect of the assignment of NRRA is that the liquidator is required to invite bids for assignment of debt. In general practice and during the corporate insolvency resolution process (‘CIRP’) also, the mode of rating the prospective bidders is assigned already, viz. the evaluation matrix. The bidders put in their bids based on the said document which in turn aids them in planning their preparation of the resolution plan, both in technical terms and in financial terms. However, in the case of assignment of NRRA, analyzing a bid is a challenging task for the reason that can be understood with the below mentioned example. A company named ABC Ltd. is under liquidation. ABC Ltd. has the following debts which can be assigned under NRRA pursuant to regulation 37A of the Liquidation Process Regulations:  100 debtors having average outstanding of Rs. 100 each, aggregating to Rs. 10,000. 500 cars having average value to Rs. 100 each, aggregating to Rs. 50,000.  However, the issue is such that all 500 cars are dispersed in different parts of the country and the liquidator does not possess knowledge of the exact location of the cars, as there has been non-cooperation from the erstwhile director of the corporate debtor and the bare minimum aforesaid details were also collated by the liquidator on the basis of the books of accounts and some employees of ABC Ltd. As for the cars that are in the possession of the liquidator, he is unable to sell them due to obligations with the regional transport office (‘RTO’) who refuses to transfer the name of the vehicle to a new owner owing to the car being registered in the name of the erstwhile promoter or director of the company. The same requires liaising and/or litigation, hence constituting a time consuming process. The liquidator in consultation with the SCC decides to assign the cars and debtors to a third person according to the provisions of regulation 37A of the Liquidation Process Regulations. Digressing for a moment, the total asset looks to be in the range of Rs. 60,000; however, it is to be borne in mind that against the total number of debtors the claim against a few debtors may have been hit by limitation and/or a few debtors are undergoing CIRP or winding up themselves, for which reason the chance of recovery is very less or negligible. However, in case of the cars, the value would have been further depreciated since the time of the aforesaid valuation, as with the lapse of time the condition of the cars would have deteriorated. Hence, while expecting that the appropriate bid from a bidder would be Rs. 60,000, as the value of the asset is also Rs. 60,000, but the same may not be economically viable for the bidder.    Coming back to the case, the liquidator issues notice under regulation 37A for assignment of debt and receives two offers, from Mr. X and Ms. Y. The details of their offers are as follows:     Description   Offer of Mr. X   Offer of Ms. Y     Upfront payment   Rs. 10,000/- upfront +   Rs. 0 as upfront +     Upon realization   10% of the realizable value   75% of the realizable     In the aforesaid case, it is very difficult to ascertain which bidder is giving a better offer as Mr. X’s upfront payment is Rs. 10,000/- plus 10% would be paid upon realization from sale of cars and recovery from the debtors, while Ms. Y’s upfront payment is nil albeit, upon realization Ms. Y agrees to pay 75%. Consequently, in such a peculiar situation, it would be difficult for the SCC and the liquidator to evaluate the bidder, but one may argue that Mr. X’s offer looks better considering that there is a component of upfront payment also. However, it may be noted that Ms. Y is offering 75% upon realization, and considering the best-case scenario that out of the total debt being assigned (Rs. 60,000), the entire amount is recovered, in that scenario 75% of Rs. 60,000 = Rs. 45,000 would go to the SCC, whilst Mr. X’s total cash outflow would be Rs. 10,000 towards upfront payment and 10% of Rs. 60,000 = Rs 6,000, aggregating to Rs. 16,000. Not to forget that the realizable value may be much lesser than Rs. 60,000. Therefore, it would be difficult to determine in whose favour the SCC should vote or who shall be declared as the successful bidder. In such a scenario, the author suggests that the notice should be published and bids shall be invited. Generally, due diligence is already carried out by the liquidator and a tentative recovery value is already known to the SCC or the liquidator. A bidder who puts in a bid near the tentative recoverable amount can have the bid approved; on the contrary, the liquidator or the SCC can always exercise its sole discretion in rejecting or accepting the offer of the bidder. But looking from another angle, the liquidator has only two options in such a situation, that is either to continue pursuing those matters, which of course is at the expense of the timing of liquidation or to try publishing a notice for NRRA and avail an opportunity to resolve the issue by assigning the same to a third party. Variation in the realizable amount from the assets offered under NRRA Generally, the nature of the assets which are kept under NRRA varies drastically. For instance, going back to the example given aforesaid, with the passage of time the cars will stop functioning and the use of car will be diminished, leading to drastic depreciation in its value. Hence, a notice issued today will invite value X from the bidders, whereas a notice issued one year thence will invite value X-1 from the bidders. The same also leads to a situation that one bidder may see a value in putting up a better upfront offer and keep a miniscule offering towards realization value; on the contrary, another bidder may see a totally opposite view of offering no upfront payment and only paying certain percentage upon realization from the asset. Further, there also arises a challenge whereby the bidder wants to settle with any debtor for an amount less than the claim amount, and the bidder will be under an obligation to recover the entire amount as the said recovery will be bifurcated between the bidder and the stakeholders. Hence, the stakeholder may not be ready to take a haircut on such settlements. In search of the effort to recover the entire amount from the said debtor, the recoverable amount (after haircut) may also be lost. Therefore, a liberty to take the best possible call has to be given to the bidder as the bidder will also be partaking in the distribution of the said recovery. Who will monitor the assignment of NRRA? The biggest challenge that surfaces in the case of NRRA is as to who will be responsible for smooth functioning of the litigation associated with the NRRA or proper management or arrangement owing to the recovery process from the NRRA after the corporate debtor is dissolved. Going back to the example aforesaid, the bidder may have to initiate legal action against the debtors of the corporate debtor which may prolong for quite a few years. In the meantime, the question arises as who will keep the track of the said litigation being pursued by the bidders, as in the case of both the bidders there is an amount payable on the realization. Unlike the case of CIRP, in the case of NRRA there is no concept of a monitoring committee which is formed with the purpose of monitoring the smooth and proper implementation of the resolution plan by the resolution applicant. Generally, the resolution professional is also a member of the said monitoring committee. In case the debts are assigned and the liquidator files an application for dissolution of the corporate debtor, a question remains to be answered as to who will look after the progress of the NRRA or who the bidder will apprise regarding the progress in the assigned litigations or consult with regarding the litigation or for settling at a lower amount than the claim amount. Hence, prima facie in such a situation it would be prudent to have a committee, which may include a member of the lead bank or members from the SCC, to whom the bidder shall give a quarterly or bi-monthly progress about the matter or do consultation with. Judgement Related to NRRA In ICICI Bank Limited v. S R Foils and Tissues Limited, liquidation was initiated against the corporate debtor on 4 March 2020. There was a pending dispute between S R Foils and Tissues Limited (‘S R Foils’) and Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation Limited (‘RIICO’) for approximately Rs. 53 lakhs which became pending towards the land belonging to S R Foils. The liquidator has not been able to sell the land owing to the dispute on the land and the litigation having been initiated by RIICO for the said amount. The liquidator attempted twice to sell the corporate debtor as a going concern twice. Both the attempts failed, and the Liquidator subsequently put up a proposal before the SCC of S R Foils to transfer or assign the said land (along with the litigation associated with it) as NRRA in accordance with the provisions of regulation 37A of the Liquidation Process Regulations. The SCC gave their confirmation and the liquidator proceeded with issuing notice for the said assignment. Fortunately, the liquidator was able to procure three bids for the said assignment of NRRA and the bid of Kalptaru Resolution Private Limited for an amount of approximately Rs. 21 crores emerged as the highest bid, which was approved by the SCC as well as the National Company Law Tribunal, Delhi Bench by way of its order dated 2 March 2023. Conclusion Assignment of NRRA is a win-win situation for all the stakeholders as well as for the liquidator, as the same aids in meeting the objective of the Code of maximization of value and abides by the time bound process as delineated in the Code. There have been numerous matters in which the liquidators have come out with notice regarding assignment of NRRA. For instance, in the matter of Shilpi Cables Technologies Limited (in Liquidation), the liquidator invited bids for assignment of NRRA around Rs. 1500 crores. In the matter of Alupan Composite Panels Private Limited (in Liquidation), the liquidator invited bids for NRRA of approximately Rs. 25 crores. In the matter of FE (India) Limited (in Liquidation), the liquidator invited bids for NRRA of approximately Rs. 277 crores. The list goes on. However, not only is the bidder required to put in a bid very carefully, that is after thorough due diligence, but even the liquidator and the SCC shall exercise precaution while drafting the agreement for the progress of the matter after the dissolution of the corporate debtor. Alternatively, it also seems that there is a loophole in the Liquidation Process Regulations relating to the situation wherein the fate of the progress of litigation or recovery proceedings, after the dissolution of the corporate debtor, has not been dealt with appropriately.   With passage of time and comfort of the stakeholders in getting accustomed to the nuances of the assignment of debt under the provisions of regulation 37A of the Liquidation Process Regulations, such assignments will flourish, with the loopholes that come in the way getting plugged by supporting the objective of the Code. – Rohit Sharma Debt Restructuring Insolvency Liquidation"

            "Reassessing the Validity of Dawn Raid in Light of French Supermarket Judgment By GuestMarch 10, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Shubham Gandhi and Sreeya Sengupta are students at NLU Jabalpur & Nirma Law Institute respectively.] The Competition Act, 2002 (“Act”) vide section 41 grants the power to the Director General (“DG”) to carry out dawn raids, i.e., a sudden, unannounced raid on the company’s offices to seize relevant documents to corroborate the investigation. This power has been largely unguided and unbridled as there are no clear guidelines for its conduct and procedure, which prompts significant concerns about its constitutionality in light of the right to privacy, being declared as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. In the recent judgment of French Supermarkets cases, the General Court of the European Union partially annulled four European Commission inspection decisions as they constituted arbitrary and unjustified interference with the privacy rights of the inspected companies. The judgment outlined requirements that must be met prior to starting dawn raids and legal recourse for the company and its employees. The judgment became pertinent for our present discussion since it outlines crucial precautions that must be performed when conducting dawn raids so that it does not become arbitrary and unconstitutional, especially in light of the Competition Amendment bill 2022 (“Amendment Bill, 2022”), which expands the power of the DG to even inspect and produce as evidence document relating to attorney-client privilege, waiving the long-standing doctrine of common law privilege. In this article, the authors will determine: 1) whether the current practices of conducting dawn raids infringe on the right to privacy; 2) whether judicial review can be recourse against dawn raids, and, finally; 3) whether the company can assert the protection of documents that constitutes as ‘sensitive personal data of employees.’ French Supermarket Judgment & Test of Sufficiently Serious Indicia The General Court of the European Union (“General Court”) issued three judgments on 5 October 2020, partially invalidating the Commission’s inspection orders to raid various French grocery chains because it determined that the dawn raids were an excessive intrusion on their right to privacy. Using the right to privacy as a justification, the applicants disputed the legitimacy of the inspection decisions. The applicants argued that the Commission’s failure to identify the businesses, locations, and individuals who would be subjected to inspection made the inspection decisions uncorroborated. The court agreed, stating that the Commission must at least provide a general identification of the businesses that will be raided. In the second part of this plea, the applicants submitted that the inspection decisions were arbitrary. When the inspection decisions were adopted, the Commission did not possess sufficient evidence of a potential infringement. The General Court considered that it is required to assess whether the Commission had ‘sufficiently serious indicia’ capable of creating a suspicion of an infringement. In other words, the Commission is required to have some form of probable cause in order to be able to initiate inspections. In India, the standard required to initiate a dawn raid is not laid down succinctly either by the Act or the rules. Moreover, there are no judgments on this issue to gain clarity. Hence, simply going by the wording of section 41, it is safe to say that the DG can carry out a dawn raid on mere suspicion with no probable cause being made out. Section 26(8) of the Amendment Bill 2022 states that “when in the course of the inquiry, the Director General has reasonable grounds to believe that information”, implying that the standard of proof required to begin an investigation is lowered by the parliament in the amendment bill, which is not appropriate, since mere reasonable suspicion should not be a ground to abridge the fundamental right to privacy. Dawn Raid vis-a-vis Right to Privacy The Indian jurisprudence surrounding the right to privacy as a fundamental right goes back to the 1960s, wherein the Supreme Court, in the case of Kharak Singh v. State of UP, held that there is no inherent right to privacy available to a person under article 21. The same was overruled in 2016 by the nine-judge bench in the landmark case of K.S Puttaswamy v. Union of India. The court held that the right to privacy is an inherent part and parcel of ‘liberty’ falling within the ambit of article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The court then went on to decipher the agreed test, i.e., the ‘test of proportionality’, which must be followed in India while assessing the case of violation of the right to privacy. It is to be borne in mind that the right to privacy is available to a natural and legal person, such as companies. It is Sanjay Kishan Kaul J., while writing the judgment in the case of K.S Puttaswamy v. Union of India, opined that proportionality could be ascertained based on the following:  Action must be sanctioned by law; Proposed action must be necessary for a democratic society for a legitimate aim; The extent of such interference must be proportionate to the need for such interference; There must be procedure guarantees against the abuse of such interference.   The points mentioned above form part of the ratio of the judgment and are binding upon all courts, and the exercise of carrying out dawn raids must pass through the following points in order to be constitutionally valid. In our opinion, the dawn raid carried out by the DG is constitutionally valid on all three fronts except the last point, as the Act does not lay down any procedural limitation or does not guarantee any procedural safeguard if, in turn, the dawn raid becomes arbitrary and violates the right to privacy. Hence, the dawn raid, in the strict sense, may be challenged before the Constitutional court, as no procedural safeguard is inherent to its functioning. Legal Remedy Against the Action of the Dawn Raid The General court in the French Supermarket judgment faces a question as to whether the company could claim a legal safeguard of the document on behalf of their employees. The court answered the said question positively. On the same lines, the authors argue that the Act allows the DG to inspect any document that, in his opinion, qualifies as evidence during a dawn raid. This creates a situation where the DG has seized documents or communications that could violate a person’s right to privacy rather than serving as evidence in the investigation. In such a scenario, although the Act does not offer any legal recourse to ask the DG to refrain from inspecting such documents or to request their return, the corporation or the individual in question must have a legal recourse under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution to the High Court to seek an order that the documents in question, be removed from the investigation. Secondly, the General court held that there is a possibility of judicial review of the dawn raid carried out by the DG as the seizure of documents during an inspection is not a separate legal act that produces legal effects separately from a final decision establishing a competition law infringement. Hence, the Company shall have the right to object to the DG’s dawn raid because there are no strict guidelines governing it in the act, which could result in arbitrary state action. So, a writ of the nature of mandamus shall always be available to the company to prove that the dawn raid was arbitrary, on any of the following grounds: –  no probable cause was made, no evidence in the nature indicating a possible anti-competitive activity,  a description of the presumed facts it intends to investigate, which should be as precise as possible; the features of the alleged infringement under investigation; the alleged affected market; the sectors covered by the alleged infringement; the nature of the alleged infringement; and  an explanation of how the investigated company is considered involved or any other reason of like nature.  Concluding Note The judgment delivered in the French Supermarket case has opened up a new debate, as the current law on carrying out dawn raids in either Indian or European jurisprudence does not extensively guarantee procedural safeguard and does not allow the parties to challenge the same on violation of its most fundamental and inviolable right of privacy. There is a growing need for draft rules of privacy safeguard in dawn raids by antitrust agencies worldwide. One such privacy protocol which can be looked upon is the Privacy Protocol that the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission introduced for dealing with such privacy claims. Also, there is an urgent need to put in place an ad hoc procedure for assessing documents seized during a dawn raid by the commission, which is suspected of containing sensitive personal data of the company’s employees. – Shubham Gandhi & Sreeya Sengupta Competition Law Constitution of India Interpretation of statutes"

            "SEBI’s Proposals to Enhance Corporate Governance by Empowering Shareholders By Umakanth VarottilFebruary 28, 20239 Min readAdd comment   Over the last decade and, in particular, following the enactment of the Companies Act, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has been gradually and consistently strengthening the governance norms pertaining to listed companies. Among other measures, SEBI has sought to focus on two specific matters, viz., (i) enhancing transparency in corporate matters; and (ii) empowering shareholders, particularly the minority, in corporate decision-making. In its latest effort in that direction, SEBI issued a consultation paper on 21 February 2023 to strengthen corporate governance in listed entities by empowering shareholders. The consultation paper addresses four somewhat disparate points: (i)        agreements binding listed entities; (ii)       special rights granted to certain shareholders; (iii)      sale, disposal or lease of assets of a listed entity outside the ‘scheme of arrangement’ framework; and (iv)      ‘board permanency’ at listed entities. The commonality surrounding these matters is that they bear the strong underlying themes of transparency and shareholder empowerment. This post briefly analyzes each of the proposals and concludes with some overarching remarks. Agreements Binding Listed Entities Under the present framework, the continuous disclosure norms in the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (the ‘LODR Regulations’) require a company to make a disclosure of agreements that are binding on the company and are outside the ordinary course of business. However, SEBI’s concerns seem to emanate from the fact that there could be agreements to which the listed company many not be a party, but such agreements may either have an impact on the management or control of the company or they may impose restrictions or create liability on the company. These could be agreements entered into by the promoters or key management of the company either among themselves or with third parties. Given that the company is not a party to these arrangements, they can be entered into surreptitiously without any form of disclosure to the shareholders of the company. Hence, SEBI has proposed to include a requirement in the LODR Regulations whereby the disclosure requirements would extend to ‘[a]greements which, either directly or indirectly or whose purpose and effect is to, impact the management or control of the listed entity or impose any restriction or create any liability upon listed entity’. This is regardless of whether the company itself is a party to such agreement or not. If enacted, this change would bring about significant transparency in governance arrangements between the principal actors in a company, such as promoters and key management. No longer would it be possible for them to act opaquely on matters of management and control of the company by entering into contractual arrangements by simply excluding the company from being a party to them. At the same time, it imposes a significant onus on promoters, key management and any other contracting parties (such as substantial investors) to be transparent regarding their arrangements. More importantly, the proposals take a further giant leap. Not only must such arrangements be disclosed, but they must also obtain the blessings of the board of the target company as well as its shareholders. SEBI’s suggestion is that the directors of the target company must provide its opinion on such agreements along with a detailed rationale, including on whether they are in the economic interest of the listed entity. This places considerable onus on the board of the target to take on board what is otherwise a private matter between promoters, key management or other shareholders. Furthermore, such arrangements also require the approval of the shareholders by way of a special resolution along with a ‘majority of the minority’ requirement, without which they will not be effective. Here again, private contractual arrangements among certain actors are hauled into the realm of corporate decision-making whereby the shareholders of the target (that too minority shareholders) have a say in the validity or otherwise of those arrangements. If implemented, these measures will eliminate behind-the-scenes contractual maneuvering by key corporate actors and shine the spotlight on them by enhancing their visibility to shareholders and other stakeholders. Moreover, the ability to carry out such contractual arrangements is also subject to their acceptability to the board of the target company (who have to act subject to their duties under corporate law) and the shareholders (in particular, the minority). Given the widespread nature of the agreements and arrangements that are covered by the proposed requirements, there could be some interpretational questions as to what kinds of agreements may be covered. For example, it is altogether understandable that a shareholders’ agreement (if it is one to which the company is not a party) will squarely fall within the remit of the present suggestion as it relates to management and control of the company. But the same cannot be said for potentially other types of agreements to which the company is not a party, but which may ‘impose a restriction or create a liability’ in respect of the listed entity, as much would depend upon the object and nature of the agreement in question. Special Rights to Certain Shareholders The existence of special rights conferred upon certain shareholders, whether promoters or others (such as private equity investors) has been a constant bone of contention, as it militates against the principle of equal treatment of all shareholders in a public listed company. Such rights include nomination rights, veto rights, anti-dilution rights and various forms of share transfer restrictions. Although the institution of these rights (typically in the articles of association of the company) requires shareholder approval, their continued operation could potentially run into perpetuity. One of the concerns also relates to the fact that certain shareholders continue to hold these rights even after their shareholding has been substantially diluted. There is currently no system by which the lasting utility of these rights is reexamined from time to time. In the consultation paper, SEBI has proposed that any such special rights granted to specific shareholders in a listed company shall be subject to shareholder approval within a period of five years from the date of conferment of such rights. For existing special rights, the shareholders have to approve their continuation within a period of five years from the time these new proposals are notified into law. This measure is altogether understandable. While the institution of these rights required shareholder approval, their continuation did not, and SEBI is only seeking to fill the gap. Sale, Disposal or Lease outside a Scheme of Arrangement Currently, corporate restructurings of various forms are governing by section 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 which, among other things, requires the approval of the National Company Law Tribunal, under whose aegis the scheme is carried out. However, transactions such as a slump sales can be carried out other than through a scheme of arrangement, which are subject to more limited governance considerations. They essentially require the approval of the shareholders under section 180(1) of the Companies Act, 2013 by way of a special resolution. Here, SEBI’s concern appears to be that parties may engage in regulatory arbitrage by effecting transactions through the slump sale route (which is subject to more limited regulatory supervision) instead of a scheme of arrangement (which has more widespread oversight). Hence, it has proposed two measures when a company seeks to sell, dispose or lease the whole or substantially the whole of its undertaking. The first is to ensure that there is proper disclosure ‘of the objects and commercial rationale for such’ a transaction to the shareholders. Second, and more importantly, SEBI seeks to include a requirement that, apart from a special resolution as required under section 180(1) of the Companies Act, the resolution must also be passed by a ‘majority of the minority’ (by which the votes cast by the public shareholders in favour of the proposal are more than the votes cast against by the public shareholders). Here again, minority shareholder empowerment appears to be the leitmotif of the proposal. Board Permanency Under the Companies Act, 2013, section 152(6) provides that at least 2/3rds of the directors of every company must be those who retire by rotation. This enables the company to appoint 1/3rd of the directors on a permanent basis, without being liable to retire by rotation. Due to such an arrangement facilitated under corporate law, either promoters or other substantial investors tend to have their nominees on company boards on a permanent basis. Such nominees can serve in their position indefinitely regardless of their performance, which is not subject to any oversight measures with consequences. Hence, SEBI has proposed that even non-retiring directors must be subject to shareholder approval requirements on a periodic basis, i.e., at least once every five years, to be able to continue in their position. This proposal, if effected, will eliminate the concept of non-retiring directors for all intents and purposes. Permanent directors who do not receive the continued support of the shareholders on a periodic basis have no place on corporate boards. This change will more significantly affect companies with promoter shareholding wherein the promoters or their nominees tend to be permanent directors. Concluding Remarks The proposals of SEBI in the current round of corporate governance reforms are significant for a number of reasons. First, they amplify the degree of transparency in governance. Transactions among promoters, key management and other shareholders need to be disclosed even if the company is not a party to them, so long as they have an impact on the company’s management and control in the manner defined. Second, they empower shareholders (especially the minority) in an extensive manner. The ‘majority of the minority’ shareholder approval requirement would extend to matters such as approving specific types of agreements that impact the company as well as slump sale and similar arrangements. Third, the tenor of the proposals is such that it enhances listed company governance substantially and in ways that are the converse of what the Companies Act, 2013 requires. For instance, the ‘majority of the minority’ requirement is introduced for slump sales, which is not a precondition under the Act. Moreover, while the Act effectively recognizes the concept of a non-retiring director, SEBI’s proposals seek to jettison such an idea in favour of directors who must periodically seek shareholder mandate, thereby making them more accountable to the shareholders. Surely, there is bound to be push back from industry as the proposals significantly enhance the compliance requirements and the associated cost burdens, but it remains to be seen whether the regulator is likely to cave in to some of those apprehensions.

            "Debenture Holders’ Right to Object to Material Related Party Transactions By GuestFebruary 28, 20237 Min read1 comment   [Vinita Nair is a Senior Partner at Vinod Kothari & Company] The Securities and Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’) continues to tighten the regulatory regime for debt-listed entities as it aims to promote the corporate bond market. After equating debt-listed entities with outstanding value of listed non-convertible debt securities of Rs. 500 crore and above with equity-listed entities for the purpose of corporate governance norms, SEBI proposes a stricter approval regime for related party transactions (‘RPTs’) under regulation 23 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘LODR’) by way of its Consultation paper on review of Corporate Governance norms for a High Value Debt Listed Entity (‘HVDLE’). This has been rolled out just before the corporate governance provisions become applicable on a mandatory basis effective from April 1, 2023. The composition of 138 HVDLEs, in terms of shareholding pattern, as on March 31, 2022 was as under:  Figure 1: Analysis of shareholding pattern of the HVDLE Existing Approval Regime for Material RPTs in Case of HVDLEs A transaction with a related party during a financial year is considered material if the transaction (entered into individually or taken together with previous transactions during a financial year) exceeds Rs. 1000 crore or 10% of the annual consolidated turnover of the listed entity as per the last audited financial statements of the listed entity. In terms of regulation 23 (4) of the LODR, material RPTs and subsequent material modifications to such material RPTs require prior approval of the shareholders of the listed entity. An exemption from the approval requirement exists for following Material RPTs: (a) transactions entered into between two government companies; (b) transactions entered into between a holding company and its wholly owned subsidiary whose accounts are consolidated with such holding company and placed before the shareholders at the general meeting for approval; and (c) transactions entered into between two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the listed holding company, whose accounts are consolidated with such holding company and placed before the shareholders at the general meeting for approval. Further, no related party is permitted to vote to approve such resolutions, in case the related party is a shareholder. This resulted in a deadlock situation for closely held HVDLEs. A debt listed entity may be a subsidiary of a holding company. The holding company, being a “related party”, will be excluded from voting. If the related parties are to be excluded from voting at the general meeting of a private company or a closely held public company, it is quite likely that there will be no shareholders whose votes may be counted! SEBI acknowledged this issue in the informal guidance given to India Infradebt Limited (discussed here) by allowing it to ‘not comply and explain’ in view of the impossibility. This situation did not arise under section 188 of Companies Act, 2013 in view of an express carve out for companies in which 90% or more members, in number, are relatives of promoters or are related parties. The expectation from SEBI was to introduce a similar carve out for HVDLEs. However, the proposal comes with a twist as it gives the debenture holders right to object such proposal. Applicability of the Proposed Regime The approval regime has been proposed in view of the shareholding pattern of the HVDLEs. As evident from Figure 1, almost 75% of the HVDLEs as on March 31, 2022 are closely held companies, where 90% or more of the shareholders are related parties. Accordingly, the approval regime has been proposed for HVDLEs having (i) only listed non-convertible debt securities and (ii) 90% or more of the shareholders in number are related parties. HVDLEs that are equity-listed entities, or have less than 90% of its shareholders as related parties, are expected to comply with the existing provision, i.e., related parties cannot vote to approve material RPTs (Refer Figure 2.)  Figure 2: Approval of material RPTs by HVDLEs Debenture Holders’ Right to Object to Material RPTs This seems to be a one-of-a-kind of proposal for RPT approval where a debenture holder will have a right to object by participating in the ordinary course of business of the listed entity, even in the absence of an event of default or breach of covenant. In terms of section 186 of Companies Act, 2013, the prior approval of a public financial institution is not required for making investments or giving a loan, guarantee or security if it is within the limits specified under section 186(2) and there is no default in repayment of loan installments or payment of interest thereon as per the terms and conditions of such loan to the public financial institution The proposed amendment surely does not confer voting rights to debenture holders, as that is not permitted under section 71(2) of Companies Act, 2013. The intent is to provide the debenture holders with a right (and not an obligation) to object in case the material RPT seems inappropriate. It could be pursuant to the fact that in case of closely held HVDLEs, shareholders’ approval is a farce as all related parties are eligible to vote. In case of equity listed entities or widely held HVDLEs, the proposal will still be approved by the shareholders who are not related parties. The lack of a response from the debenture holder is deemed a “no-objection” and, therefore, the objections received should be measured as a percentage to the total debentures and not just those who have submitted their response. However, the illustration in the consultation seems to provide otherwise, which should be reconsidered by SEBI. If the total value of outstanding debentures is Rs. 1000 crore, in that case the material RPT should be withdrawn only if objection is received from debenture holders holding debentures of value of Rs. 750 crore or more. The concept of “present and voting” is not applicable in this case.  Figure 3: Procedure for approval of material RPTs by HVDLEs Impact of Proposed Amendment Prior to this amendment, so long the debt was continued to be serviced and the terms and conditions of borrowing were met, the debenture holders were not required to intervene in the regular operations of the company. If there was a covenant to that effect in the debenture subscription agreement or debenture trust deed or terms of issue, in that case, irrespective of whether the RPT is material or immaterial, the borrowing entity was required to comply. With this amendment, if notified, the debenture holders will also have a say in corporate governance, especially in case of material RPTs pursuant to a provision of law. Other lenders extending term loan and other facilities, and who have a larger exposure on such companies, will not have this opportunity. It may be argued that companies raise debt for general corporate purpose and to meet working capital requirements and, in the absence of a specific end use, there is no deviation in the use of proceeds. If there is a default, the debenture trustee will be required to nominate a person on the board of directors of the listed entity in terms of regulation 15(1)(e) of the SEBI (Debenture Trustees) Regulations, 1993 and, accordingly, will be able to protect the interest of the debenture holders. However, the intent here seems to provide a right to govern and object in exceptional cases. This also comes with a risk that closely held HVDLEs may stand to lose, as debenture holders may object proposals which may seem unclear to them. One will have to wait and watch the impact of this amendment, once notified. – Vinita Nair Corporate Governance Debt Finance SEBI Securities Regulation"

            "Modification v. Partial Setting Aside – Whether Two Sides of the Same Coin? By GuestFebruary 27, 202310 Min readAdd comment   [Pallavi Mishra and Drishti Rajain are advocates practicing in the Delhi High Court] While the law has been settled by the Supreme Court (“SC”) in The Project Director, National v. M Hakeem (“M. Hakeem”) and affirmed in NHAI v. P. Nagaraju (“P. Nagaraju”) with respect to the lack of court’s jurisdiction to “modify” an arbitral award, the recent line of judgements rendered by the High Courts (discussed below) have drawn a parallel between ‘modification’ and ‘partial setting aside’ of the award – re-igniting the debate over a civil court’s jurisdiction to interfere in the arbitral process. The post attempts to analyse the emergence of a ‘new’ position post M. Hakeem, inter alia distinguishing the scope of modification vis-à-vis partial setting aside of an arbitral award to comprehend: (i) whether the latter does in fact form a subset of modification and the High Courts have erred in unsettling the law established by the SC and, (ii) the permissibility of ‘partial setting aside’ of an arbitral award within the restricted scope of section 34, Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the A&C Act”). Brief overview of principles in question A bare perusal of section 34 postulates that the inherent powers of reviewing vested in an appellate court have been specifically restricted by the statute with respect to a challenge to the arbitral award. While adjudicating upon the interpretation of section 34 in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. (“McDermott”), the SC held that court’s power under section 34 of the A&C Act is limited to either setting aside the award or remitting the award to the arbitrator under section 34(4) to eliminate any grounds of challenge to the award. Besides and in addition to section 34(2), the 2015 Amendment introduced ‘patent illegality’ [section 34(2A)] as a ‘narrow’ ground to set aside the award in domestic arbitrations, if found contrary to the substantive provisions of A&C Act or terms of the contract. As a matter of law, upon setting aside of the award, the parties are placed in a position to agitate the issues ad nauseum even on the aspects of award neither challenged nor expressly set aside by the court under section 34 petition. The precedent laid down in McDermott stating that the courts have a limited supervisory role were affirmed in Kinnari Mullick v. Ghanshyam Das Damani and Dyna Technologies Pvt. Ltd v. Crompton Greaves Ltd.  In the recent case of M. Hakeem, the bench upon perusal of the above-stated judgements inter alia acknowledged the divergent views on the point of court’s power to “modify, vary or remit” the award, and specifically engaged with contradictory views to lay down a determinative approach to foster unanimity on this aspect. M. Hakeem went on to particularly overrule the judgement rendered by a Single Bench of the Madras High Court in Gayatri Balaswamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd. (as was heavily relied upon by the Respondent) on grounds of inconsistency with McDermott, thereby laying down an instructive precedent against modification of arbitral award. The judgement rendered in M. Hakeem and concurred by division bench in P. Nagaraju to this extent affixes a seal on the irresistible conclusion that intervention of the court under the A&C Act is restricted to either setting it aside or remitting it to the arbitrator to the extent necessary for elimination of the defects therein.   However, the common central question unanswered/untouched by these judgements revolves around comprehending as to whether partial rejection of a severable part of an award constitutes excessive judicial interference pursuant to the strict caution against ‘modification’ as laid down by M. Hakeem and P. Nagaraju. Position taken by the High Courts at Delhi, Kerala and Bombay The recent line of judgements delivered by the High Courts at Delhi, Kerala and Bombay in the last few months, have attempted to carve out an exception to ‘modification’ or rather, distinguish modification from ‘partial setting aside’ of an award. The latest judgement delivered by Single Bench of the Delhi High Court in Union of India v. Alcon Builders and Engineers Pvt. Ltd. considered this question in context of a dispute comprising multiple claims decided by the arbitrator, wherein each claim stood separate and distinct from the other. The Court placed reliance on SC’s ratio in JG Engineers Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India where the Division Bench had held that “the court will segregate the award on items which (do) not suffer from any infirmity and uphold the award to that extent.…”. Following this precedent, the Learned Single Judge rendered a finding that the award in question was capable of being partly set aside solely on the aspect of ‘pendente-lite interests and costs’ and such partial setting aside of the award would not amount to modification. The Court while partly setting aside the award recorded that the same is in-line with the overarching principle of minimal judicial interference contemplated under the A&C Act. In National Highways Authority of India v. The Additional Commissioner the Bombay High Court addressed the question concerning whether the Court is mandatorily required to wholly set aside the award even when convinced that the error has been committed only on specific issues, barring which the award would stand sustainable. The Court while answering in negative, distinguished the ratio in M. Hakeem stating that the precedent was not ‘directly relevant’ for the issue of whether an award can be set aside partly. The Court relied on the ratio of the Full Bench of Bombay High Court rendered in RS Jiwani (M/S.) v. Ircon International Ltd. which squarely dealt with the application of doctrine of severability to arbitral award and observed that if “partial challenge to an award is permissible then why not partial setting aside of an award.” Lastly, the final judgement (as on date of writing this post) on this point emerges from the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in Navayuga Engineering Company Ltd. v. Union of India where preliminary objections were raised on maintainability of the petition on grounds of ‘partial setting aside’ of the award by the District Court. The Kerala High Court negatived the objections on the reasoning that setting aside claims in the award which did not suffer from any infirmities would result in ‘gross injustice and absurd results’, which could not have possibly been contemplated by the Legislature. Analysis Before delving into analysis, at the outset, it is necessary to separate the facts of M. Hakeem which categorically dealt with inter-dependent claims pertaining to award of inadequate compensation for land acquisition and did not in fact have any scope for possible severing of claims for partial setting aside. Keeping this in view, what appears is that M. Hakeem actually remains silent on whether there is any bar under section 34 in applying doctrine of severability to arbitral awards consisting of multiple claims eventually leading to ‘partial setting aside’ of the award. Proceeding on this premise, it will not be incorrect to state that the High Courts have not erred in drawing a parallel between M. Hakeem and other cases at hand.  The authors acknowledge that in MBL Infrastructures Ltd. v. Telecommunication Consultants of India, a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court had stated that the award is to be set aside as a ‘whole’, however, the same is particular to the peculiar facts and context of that case, wherein the Learned Single Judge had proceeded to correct the errors of the award which, undisputedly cannot be done under section 34. However, the Division Bench abstained from expressing any opinion on the question of setting aside some claims (without modifying the findings) in contrast to all claims comprising the award under section 34 of the A&C Act. Thus, similarly to M. Hakeem, the dictum does not directly address the issue in question. Besides the conundrum of judicial precedents, it is important to peruse the language of section 34, a bare reading of which does not admit of any limitation to divest the Court of the power to ‘partially set aside’ an award on claims which are separate and distinct from each-other. The court in doing so is neither correcting nor amending the findings on merits of the case, hence the question of ‘modification’ – even in its widest connotation does not arise. In authors’ view, to state that the judgements of the High Courts have been rendered per incuriam to the precedent laid down in M. Hakeem et al. would be an argument on the surface, bereft of merit due to its failure to capture the true legislative intent and interpretation of the provisions of the A&C Act. It is clear that severability is not a new issue and has been considered by precedents prior to M. Hakeem. Purely on the aspect of equity as well, it would be unjust to deny the benefits accrued upon the parties by not applying the doctrine of severability if some part of the award is unsustainable and while the other part is found to be good and enforceable in law by the court. The word “set aside” appearing in section 34(2) cannot be narrowly construed to imply setting aside the award ‘wholly’ to prejudice the discretion vested in the court supported by the fact that the very purpose and object underlying the A&C Act is to provide for a speedy mechanism for adjudication of disputes. Such object would stand frustrated if each time the parties are forced to agitate the issues which did not in fact suffer from infirmities. It could not have been the intent of the legislature to direct the parties to undertake multiple rounds of litigation on already settled claims. Neither the Model Law nor section 34 (pari materia to Model Law) contemplate barring the court’s jurisdiction in applying doctrine of severability which is a fundamental judicial expression to minimise elongation of litigious processes. Conclusion At this juncture, given the new dimension of judgements rendered by various High Courts, it is fairly evident to state that ‘modification’ and ‘partial setting aside of the award’ are not two sides of the same coin, and operate on distinct levels within the challenge made under section 34. In case a particular claim within the arbitral award remains undisturbed or confirmed by the court, it is necessary to exercise caution against setting aside findings which are resultantly undisputed between the parties. Keeping up with its previous judicial trends, question remains that if in later judgements the SC concludes that partial setting aside of the award does in fact form a subset of modification, a valid scope remains open for legislative amendment to carve out an exception for partial setting aside of the award to save the parties from re-agitating issues that neither stand nor fall – in other words – remain severable and unchallenged by consensus. Parallel yet similar to the issue discussed in this post, guidance is drawn from Sssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI where the SC had exercised wide powers under Article 142 to uphold and apply the formula of compensation rendered by the minority award. It is desirable that instead of utilising the jurisdiction of the SC under Article 142, an amendment to clarify the position on “partial setting aside” of award is introduced in A&C Act, given its self-contained nature. Extensive guidance can be drawn from the jurisdictions of England, United States and Canada concerning the powers of a court to modify an award (as to whether partial setting aside forms subset of modification), if at all considerations of amendment to scope of section 34 remain valid in the coming times. Moreover, given the differing positions taken in various above-stated judgements, it is desirous for a larger bench to settle the difference between “modification” and “partial setting aside” of the arbitral award under section 34 of the A&C Act. – Pallavi Mishra and Drishti Rajain Arbitration"

            "Taking away the Attorney-Client Privilege: Competition Amendment Bill, 2022 By GuestFebruary 22, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Shubham Gandhi is a 5th year student at NLU, Jabalpur and Hricha Gandhi is an Advocate at Rajasthan High Court]  The concept of Attorney-Client privilege (“ACP’’) has become one of the quintessential principles across all global jurisdictions. It simply enunciates that the communication made by the client to its attorney during the course of employment or any document shared will be inadmissible in court, as an evidence. The reason is to advance the free and open communication between the client and the attorney regarding the pending suit. In the latest draft of the Competition Amendment Bill, 2022, this principle has been put on trial, as the bill grants unrestricted power to Director General (“DG”) to carry out a search and seizure. Moreover, the bill further extends the already unbridled power and allows DG to admit into proceedings any communication or document which may form part of legal privilege. In this post, the authors will delve into the status of protection to privileged communication in dawn raids before and after the amendment bill, protection granted to privileged communication in other jurisdictions, and comment upon whether the amendment is apt or needs necessary changes. The Competition Amendment Bill, 2022 The Competition Act, 2002, under the provision of section 41, mentions the power of the DG to conduct a dawn raid if it apprehends that the parties may attempt altering, hide, destroying, mutilating, falsifying or tampering with the physical documents as well as the documents stored in desktops/laptops/servers/phones which would be irretrievable in due course. In order to carry out the dawn raid, the DG must file an application before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi, and obtain a warrant. There are only five incidents in the Indian Competition Regime wherein the DG has conducted dawn raids. In none of these five matters, the issue of protection of ACP became the question of law. It is interesting to note that the present law nowhere expressly talks about whether the DG’s power to investigate extends to confiscating and using the documents and communication made during the privilege; hence the law is ambiguous with this aspect. However, the new amendment made via section 26 of the Amendment Bill, 2022, amending section 41 of the present act, in clear terms states that the : “(3) Without prejudice to sub-section (2), it shall be the duty of all officers, other employees and agents of a party which are under investigation—  (a) to preserve and to produce all information, books, papers, other documents and records of, or relating to, the party which are in their custody or power to the Director General or any person authorised by it in this behalf; and  (b) to give all assistance in connection with the investigation to the Director General. Explanation. —For the purposes of this section, —  (a) “agent,” in relation to any person, means, any one acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of such person, and includes the bankers and legal advisers of, and persons employed as auditors by, such person;” The plain meaning of the section reasoned out that it is the duty of the agents of the party, i.e., legal advisers of the party, to produce “all information, documents, and records relating to the party,” which includes privileged communication and the documents used during the course of employment. The amending section does not contain any exceptions; hence, the legislature intends to include ACP communication and documents in the purview of the investigation carried out by the DG. ACP and Evidence Act, 1872 In the Indian legal system, the ACP or professional communication privilege is mentioned in section 126 of the Indian Evidence act. The act prescribes that: – “No barrister, attorney, pleader or vakil shall at any time be permitted, unless with his client’s express consent, to disclose any communication made to him…or to state the contents or condition of any document with which he has become acquainted in the course and for the purpose of his professional employment, or to disclose any advice given by him to his client in the course and for the purpose of such employment.” Further, by section 129, this privilege is extended to legal advisers, as it states, “No one shall be compelled to disclose to the Court any confidential communication which has taken place between him and his legal professional adviser.” It is to be noted that the present amendment via section 26 of the bill is in direct contravention of the Evidence act. However, one has to keep in mind the age-old principle of construction that the special law can be made in violation of the general law, i.e., the legislature is competent to frame a special law overriding the general law. ACP in Global Competition regimes  The Swiss Competition Commission, in accordance with section 42, may request a search and seizure. However, this power does not extend to the seizure of any communication of documents that may constitute Legal Professional Privilege (“LPP”). Communications that are protected only include those with lawyers (i) listed in the Swiss cantonal bar register or (ii) listed in member states of the EU or EEA and are qualified to practice law in their home country. In the European Union, LPP safeguards correspondence between attorneys and clients. In the case of AM & S Europe Limited v. Commission of the European Communities, where the Court of Justice ruled that the confidentiality of written communications between attorneys and clients should be safeguarded at a community level, this privilege was established. In the case of Akzo Noble chemicals and Akcros Chemicals v. Commission, the European Court of Justice formally upheld the abovementioned position. According to Hong Kong law, LPP applies to conversations between attorneys and clients made with the intention of receiving advice. The privilege mentioned above also covers communications with in-house attorneys offering independent legal services. To ensure that LPP concerns occurring in the context of dawn raids are handled impartially and quickly, the Hong Kong Competition Commission has produced guidelines titled “Investigation Powers of the Competition Commission and Legal Professional Privilege.” The Commission aims to accomplish this by: (a) minimizing the possibility that Commission staff members involved in the investigation will unintentionally read privileged material; (b) making sure that any disputed material found during a search is correctly identified, isolated, and securely stored pending resolution of the dispute; (c) endeavoring to ensure that disputes relating to LPP are resolved by agreement between the commission and the investigated parties to the extent possible; and (d) ensuring the prompt return of any material or information to its rightful owner as soon as it is determined that LPP protects the material or information. Regarding professional privilege before competition authorities, Mexico has no explicit legislation. However, the investigative division of the Federal Economic Competition Commission (“COFECE”) is authorized to request any information or documents relevant to their ongoing investigations under Article 73 of the Federal Law on Economic Competition. In addition to the foregoing, Article 75 provides that COFECE has the authority to authorize the execution of dawn raids and on-site inspections to gather information and documents pertinent to the inquiry. Regarding the use of client-lawyer communications, it is, however, absolutely quiet. Recently, COFECE announced guidelines for handling interactions between attorneys and clients that are remarkably similar to those released by Hong Kong. Conclusion The change suggested by the Amendment Bill 2022 is one of significant importance. The privilege granted to Attorney-client communication is one of great importance, and by taking away that privilege, the parliament is causing unjust to the parties, who may seek advice from the lawyer without fully disclosing the contents of the disputes. Also, the section prescribes that the search and seizure are to be carried out as per the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC”), which is a fallacy, as the CrPC is framed to facilitate search and seizure in a criminal proceeding, whereas, the Competition Act is of a civil nature. The parameters, parties, and the object of search and seizure in CrPC differ in comparison to the Competition act. Furthermore, there is no opportunity, prescribe in the act, for the party to dispute or challenge the search carried out by the DG. It is to be borne in mind that the proceedings directly contradict the individual’s privacy as per Article 21. Hence, the law lacks proper safeguards for individual and corporation privacy rights, and it does not grant any opportunity to object to the search carried out by the DG. In the author’s opinion, the power granted to DG is without limitation, which can lead to indulgence in an arbitrary action. Also, there can be certain cases wherein the DG may admit documents or communication made by the party to its attorney, which may result in self-incrimination, directly violating the mandate of Article 20(3) of the Indian Constitution. In conclusion, the amendment provision in the present state can be utilized by the DG to conduct illegal and arbitrary searches. The provision must be reformed, respecting privacy and allowing the party to object to the search or seizure. – Shubham Gandhi & Hricha Gandhi Competition Act International Developments Interpretation of statutes"

            "The Constitutional Validity of Deeming Fictions Under the GST Law By GuestFebruary 20, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Prakruthi Jain is a 3rd year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) student at NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad] The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) was introduced by the 101st Amendment Act in 2016. This was followed by the introduction of the four Acts, i.e., the Central Goods and Services Tax Act (“CGST”), the Integrated Goods and Services Act (“IGST”), the Union Territories Goods and Services Tax Act (UTGST) and the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act (SGST) in 2017. This post deals with the provisions of the IGST Act (“the Act”) pertaining to the imposition of tax on transactions where the place of supply is outside India but has been taxed using the Reverse Charge Mechanisms and deeming fiction to bring them under the ambit of taxable transactions. Interplay of GST with the Constitutional Scheme for Taxation Article 246A of the Constitution of India empowers the Parliament to provide for GST over the interstate supply of goods or services or both. Further, Article 269A(5) of the Constitution empowers the Parliament to formulate principles to ascertain the place of supply in matters of interstate transactions, upon which subject matter, the GST council shall make recommendations by virtue of Article 279A(4)(c) of the Constitution. Heed must be paid to the constitutional restrictions placed on the taxing powers of the State under Article 286 of the Constitution of India, more specifically, the restriction on taxing transactions where the supply takes place outside India. These restrictions have an overriding effect over any power conferred to tax, either by the Constitution or any other statute, and any such power must be read in harmony with the restrictions, which would otherwise render the provision nugatory. Several attempts have been made under the various GST Acts to impose taxes on transactions taking place outside India using the cloak of a deeming fiction, thereby subverting the constitutional restriction imposed under Article 286 of the Constitution. GST is a destination-based consumption tax, in contrast with the principle of taxation based on origin, as clarified by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs. This implies that the incidence and liability of the tax shall accrue on the person who consumes the goods or services and where such consumption occurs. Therefore, it is imperative to note that although the Constitution empowers the Parliament to lay down the principles determining the place of supply, such a power cannot be interpreted to mean that the Parliament is empowered to impose a tax on transactions taking place outside India. In other words, when consumption is taking place outside India, it cannot be treated as a local supply by playing around with the principles of determining the place of supply. Such an interpretation would defeat the purpose of the Constitutional embargo on taxing extra-territorial transactions and fall foul of the inherent nature of GST as a destination-based tax. Therefore, such extra-territorial application of laws does not fall within the constitutional framework nor the ambit of the statutory scheme of the GST regime. The doctrine of pith and substance would enable us to look beyond the bare provisions of the Act and understand the true nature of supply and place of supply of a given transaction. In actuality, if a good or service is being consumed outside the territory of India and such consumption is sought to be taxed, severe doubts would be raised about the legislative competence of the Parliament to tax such transactions as no such power can be derived from Article 269A of the Constitution nor the charging sections of the Acts. Such a provision would also fall foul of the principle of equality enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution in as much as it “seeks to impose on the same class of property, persons, transactions or occupations similarly situate incidence of taxation, which leads to an obvious inequality”, as held in V. Venugopala Ravi Varma Rajah v. Union Of India. Constitutionality of Section 13(8)(b) of the IGST Act The recent controversy regarding the status of intermediary services vis-à-vis exports is an example of the above debate. The controversy deepened with the split verdict by the Bombay High Court in the case of Dharmendra M Jani v. Union of India. In this case, the constitutional validity of section 13(8)(b) of the IGST Act was questioned. The IGST Act governs the imposition of GST over the transactions pertaining to the inter-state supply of goods and services, with intricate provisions dealing with what constitutes an inter-state supply, determination of place of supply, exemption to exports, and exceptions to the general principle that the place of supply is the place of the recipient of goods and services as the GST is a destination-based consumption tax. Section 13(8)(b) refers to intermediary services. It provides for one such exception to the general rule of determining the place of supply, implying that in the case of intermediary services, the supplier’s location shall be the place of supply as opposed to the recipient’s location. Therefore, in the case of intermediary services, even if the Indian intermediary service provider is providing services to customers outside India, it would not amount to an “export” and would be taxable under the IGST Act as an inter-state supply. This was challenged as being violative of the rights under Article 19(1)(g) as it places an “unreasonable restriction upon the right of the petitioner to carry on trade and business,” among other grounds. The reasoning adopted by the GST Council to keep intermediary services outside the purview of the tax benefit afforded to “exports” is to eliminate ambiguity about the place of supply in relation to goods and services and to prevent loss of revenue to the government. Furthermore, it was justified on the basis that such a provision would incentivize foreign companies to set up manufacturing in India to enjoy the tax benefits on exports, thereby bolstering the ‘Make in India’ program. On the contrary, the Parliamentary Committee Report titled the “Impact of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on Exports” noted that 18% IGST was attracted on transactions where the primary supplier and buyer are both located outside India, and only the intermediary was located in India by virtue of the legal fiction created under section 13(8)(b) of the IGST Act. This is contrary to the arguments advanced in favor of such imposition. Consequently, the report recommended that intermediary services be treated as exports, or in the alternative, an exemption must be provided for Indian intermediaries against the levy of IGST under section 6(1) of the IGST Act. Pursuant to this, vide a notification, Indian intermediaries were exempt from payment of IGST on transactions where both the buyer and the seller were located outside India. Another concern raised by such a levy is double taxation, or the problem of tax on tax. Although the intermediary in India is paying tax on the commission earned by it, GST would also be levied on the Indian importer who purchases the said goods. Additionally, in cases where the recipient of the supply is located outside the Indian territory, it would be impossible to pass on the tax burden onto the consumer, which violates both the indirect element as well as the destination-based consumption nature of the levy. Judicial Inconsistency in Interpreting the Deeming Fictions Although the courts have hesitated to strike down the provision related to intermediary services in Dharmendra M Jani, Material Recycling Association and Genpact India Pvt. Ltd., the controversy of deemed legal fiction is not restricted to intermediaries. Section 13(9) of the IGST Act provides for a similar legal fiction, wherein “the place of supply of services of transportation of goods, other than by way of mail or courier, shall be the place of destination of such goods.” The Parliamentary Committee report made similar remarks on this categorization and noted “the disparity in respect of freight payable during export of goods since engaging a foreign-based shipping line does not attract GST whereas engaging an Indian shipping line would be liable to GST”. The Committee recommended that provisions of the IGST Act should be accordingly amended to “bring exports made by Indian shipping lines at par with foreign shipping lines and provide a level playing field for Indian Shipping Industry.” Although the place of supply under section 13(9) of the IGST Act is the location of the supplier, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, in the recent case of Union of India v. Mohit Minerals Pvt. Ltd., held that even if the supplier of such services is located outside India while the recipient being in India, such a transaction can attract a levy of IGST. This is because “the destination of the goods is India, and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer.” Therefore, what can be seen is a trend to blow hot and cold at the same time to interpret the taxing provisions according to the benefit of the State’s revenue, in utter disregard of the Constitutional architecture governing the taxing powers of the State. Such a situation leads to uncertainty and runs contrary to the purpose of the “One Nation, One Tax” regime, which is aimed at uniformity, consistency, global competitiveness, and transparency. – Prakruthi Jain Taxation"

            "Rethinking Interest on TDS/ TCS Credit under GST Law in India: Part 2 By GuestFebruary 19, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Manohar Samal is an Associate Advocate at Ratan Samal & Associates, Mumbai and a Panel Arbitrator at the Indian Institute of Arbitration and Mediation. This is continued from Part 1] Current Mechanism for Levy of Interest Now that the basic outline of the GST law in India has been discussed, the manner of levy of interest under the GST statutes can be discussed. The CGST Act, 2017 envisages two forms of interest and apply to other GST statutes parallelly. The first form of interest stipulated under the statute is the interest which is levied on late payment of taxes. The rate of interest applicable on late payment of taxes has been notified as eighteen percent per annum. Since the output liability of GST can be created by making a payment through the electronic cash ledger as well as making an adjustment of input tax credit available in the electronic credit ledger, in the initial years, interest was being levied by the GST Department on the portion of late adjustments made from the electronic credit ledger. However, this was remedied by way of insertion of proviso to sub- section (1) of Section 50 of the CGST Act, 2017 which clarified that interest can only be levied on ‘net cash liability’ that are late payments of tax which are made from the electronic cash ledger. For some time thereafter, a lack of clarity in respect of its retrospective operation existed and was resolved by two decisions of the Madras High Court (here and here) wherein it was held that the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 50 of the CGST Act, 2017 applies with retrospective effect. Therefore, it is a settled position now that interest can only be levied on belated payments of tax made from the electronic cash ledger, but it cannot be levied on belated adjustments of input tax credit made from the electronic credit ledger. The second form of interest stipulated under the statute is the interest which is levied when input tax credit is wrongly availed and utilized. The rate of interest applicable for such interest is twenty- four percent per annum. However, for the purposes of this post, only the first form of interest is relevant. Eliminating the Levy of Interest on TDS and TCS Credit Adjustments Against Late Payments of Tax Liability The need for eliminating the imposition of interest on late adjustments of TDS and TCS credits from the electronic cash ledger arises from the fact that such adjustments of TDS and TCS credits are nothing but adjustments of credits on which tax has already been paid, similar to input tax credits. The difference is that input tax credits are credits of input tax that are already paid to the Government treasury and TDS and TCS credits are credits of output tax which are already paid to the Government treasury. As pointed out earlier, sub-section (1) of section 50 does not levy interest on late adjustments of input tax credit made from the electronic credit ledger. Despite the fact that credits of input tax as well as credits of TDS and TCS represent tax which is already paid to the Government, differential treatment in respect of leviability of interest continues to exist merely because of the fact that TDS and TCS credits are adjusted from the electronic cash ledger as opposed to input tax credit adjustments which are made from the electronic credit ledger. The core reason why this is detrimental to a taxpayer is that interest should only be levied when there is a loss to the revenue and, in the instances of TDS and TCS credit, since tax has already been paid, there is no loss to the revenue and, yet, interest is being levied, making it contrary to the principles laid down by the Supreme Court of India in the Pratibha Processors judgment. For better clarity, the issue is being explained with the help of three illustrations. For the purposes of the first illustration, assume that Company “A” has defaulted in filing its returns on the due date and the GST amount which was supposed to be paid with such returns was rupees fifty thousand. The returns are filed after one year by late adjustments of available input tax credits in the ‘electronic credit ledger’. No interest is payable in such instance because of the retrospective operation of the proviso to section 50 of the CGST Act, 2017. For the purposes of the second illustration, let the same example be taken where Company “A” files its returns and pays rupees fifty thousand after one year by late payments made from the ‘electronic cash ledger’ and the said payments were completely deposited from the taxpayer’s bank account to the electronic cash ledger. Interest at the rate of eighteen percent is payable in such instance along with the late filing of returns and late payment. For the purposes of the third illustration, let the same example be taken with an addition that Company “A” already had rupees forty thousand as TDS Credit which was lying in its electronic cash ledger. The taxpayer made a deposit of rupees ten thousand from its bank account to the electronic cash ledger. Thereafter, the taxpayer made late payment of rupees ten thousand and late adjustment of TDS credit of rupees forty thousand. Although interest at the rate of eighteen percent should only be levied on the portion of rupees ten thousand since it was a belated remittance and not on the portion of adjustment of TDS credit of rupees forty thousand since it represents tax paid credit which is due in the favor of the taxpayer, interest as per the current mechanism of the GST law is being levied on the entire portion creating differential treatment between those adjusting late taxes by input tax credit and those adjusting late taxes by TDS/ TCS credit merely on account of a technical reason; the said technical reason being that TDS/ TCS credit, unlike input tax credit, is credited in the electronic cash ledger. The consequence of such differential treatment is that taxpayers, albeit at equal footing, are treated differently leading to suppliers of services to Governmental authorities and Governmental agencies and e-commerce operators to face additional interest liability, which is not compensatory in nature to the revenue, but is nonetheless being collected unjustly. On a plain reading of the relevant statutory provisions, the legislative intent which can be gathered is that it was never the intention of the legislature to permit the levy of interest on the portion of late GST payments which are made by adjusting TDS/TCS credits from the electronic cash ledger. This is evident from two aspects in the statute. The first aspect is that section 49 of the CGST Act, 2017 only considers deposits from internet banking, credit cards, debit cards, NEFT, RTGS or other prescribed modes to be a part of the electronic cash ledger, and no mention of TDS credits or TCS credits are made anywhere. Coming to the second aspect, the terminology used in the proviso to section 50 read with rule 88B(1) is “paid by debiting the electronic cash ledger”. Notably, TDS/TCS credits are tax-paid credits in favour of a taxpayer and, therefore, is in the nature of a benefit which is granted to a taxpayer on the fulfilment of all the conditions by the recipient as well as the supplier of goods or service. Since such credits are in the nature of benefits conferred by the statute, they cannot be “paid” but can only be “adjusted” against output tax liability. Under such circumstances, it seems as if the legislative intent was never to permit the levy of interest on late adjustments of TDS/TCS credits and yet, authorities of the goods and services tax departments across all States have continued to calculate interest on the entire gross portion of cash liability instead of the net cash tax liability due to lack of sufficient clarity on the subject. Such differential treatment being faced by a class of taxpayers that are entitled to claim TDS/ TCS credit, as the case may be, can only be remedied by way of an insertion in the statute book. The most viable option seems to be an explanation or a second proviso to section 50(1) of the CGST Act, 2017, which can clarify that interest cannot be levied on TDS/TCS credit since it represents tax paid credit which is due to an assessee even though it is credited to the electronic cash ledger.     Conclusion In pursuance of the discussions carried out in the aforesaid paragraphs, the clarifications proposed may be the need of the hour so that suppliers of services to governmental authorities and governmental agencies and e-commerce operators do not face differential treatment in the levy of interest despite being equals to the class of taxpayers making late adjustments of output liability by way of available input tax credit.

            "Rethinking Interest on TDS/ TCS Credit under GST Law in India: Part 1 By GuestFebruary 18, 20237 Min readAdd comment   [Manohar Samal is an Associate Advocate at Ratan Samal & Associates, Mumbai and a Panel Arbitrator at the Indian Institute of Arbitration and Mediation] The concept of interest under tax law has been one of the most significant sources of compensating the Government treasury for non-compliance with tax statutes in India. The most common forms of non-compliance for which interest is levied on the portion of tax amount computed are late filing of tax returns, claim of benefits or concessions under tax statutes without satisfaction of the mandatory conditions stipulated and non-payment of tax. The Supreme Court of India has stated that the inherent quality of interest under tax statutes is that it is compensatory in nature and such compensation is granted for any losses in taxes which are faced by the Government treasury. Even though the inherent nature of interest is compensatory, time and again, it has been witnessed that the tax administration has levied interest in the absence of any loss to the Government treasury. One of those situations is when interest is levied on late adjustment of tax deducted at source (TDS) credit and tax collected at source (TCS) credit while filing of goods and services tax (GST) returns. Due to the hyper-technical nature of discussions related to the issue being addressed, an attempt has been made to first explain the outline of the GST law in India and, then, proceed to the specific issue being dealt in the present post, with an aim to showcase the need for eliminating the levy of interest on TDS and TCS credit adjustments.   Outline of the Goods and Services Tax Law in India The GST law is the unified indirect tax system which has subsumed several forms of indirect taxes that were extant earlier in order to prevent the cascading effect of multiple taxes and to create a seamless flow of input tax credit. Such a unified indirect tax mechanism was brought forth by imbibing the spirit of co-operative federalism under Article 246A of the Constitution of India. Resultantly, several statutes have emerged, viz., the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017, the State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) Act, 2017, the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax (UTGST) Act, 2017, the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST)  Act, 2017 and the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017. Charging Mechanism The CGST Act, 2017 applies to all intra-state supplies of goods or services or both goods and services made in composite or mixed supplies. The SGST Act, 2017 (which is enacted with specific name of the respective States) and the UTGST Act, 2017 are pari materia statutes which apply conjointly to intra-state supplies of goods or services or both goods and services made in composite or mixed supplies. The IGST Act, 2017 applies to all inter-state supplies of goods and services or both goods and services made in composite or mixed supplies. The expression ‘inter- state’ has the effect of including supplies from one state or union territory to another state or union territory. inter-state supplies also include imports and exports as well as supplies from and to special economic zones. The GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 levies a cess on the tax amount of CGST and IGST, as the case maybe, with an intent to compensate the states for the loss of revenue that has occurred due to the change in indirect tax system.    The scope of supply is envisaged under the CGST Act, 2017, and the other GST statutes have adopted the scope of supply provided thereunder. Supply embraces sale, transfer, barter, exchange, rental, license, lease and disposal which are made in the course or furtherance of business for a consideration. Several transactions which do not satisfy the aforementioned requirement have also been treated as supplies through legal fiction under Schedules I and II appended to the CGST Act, 2017 and such supplies are referred to as deemed supplies. Similarly, a few transactions which would fall under the scope of supply have been excluded under Schedule III of the CGST Act, 2017.   Classification and Rate of Tax For the purposes of classification, notifications have been issued by the Central Government in accordance with the recommendations of the GST Council. The classification of goods under GST is aligned to the First Schedule of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 which, in turn, is aligned to the Harmonised System of Nomenclature, which is a product of the International Convention on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System. The classification of services is based on the Services Accounting Code which has been devised by the GST Council and is inspired by the United Nations Central Product Classification. There are several rates of tax slabs provided and they are zero-point two five percent, three percent, five percent, twelve percent, eighteen percent and twenty eight percent.    Input Tax Credit Mechanism Input tax credit is the benefit which has been conferred by the GST statutes on suppliers of goods and services in order to eliminate the cascading effect of taxes. The GST is a form of value added tax where the value of taxes is added in the chain of transactions and, owing to its destination-based nature, the tax should be levied only where the goods or services are consumed. This means that only the end consumer should bear the entire amount of GST and the cascading effect of the value of taxes being added in the chain of transactions should not be borne by the manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, or service provider, as the case maybe. In order to ensure that such cascading effects are eliminated, a benefit is conferred by the GST statutes in the form of input tax credit. An input tax credit is nothing but a set-off which is made available to all registered taxpayers after the fulfilment of conditions as laid down under the statute. The said set-off is granted by way of crediting the electronic credit ledger with the taxes paid on the purchase of input goods or input services, and the balance in the electronic credit ledger comprising the said input tax credit can be adjusted against output tax liabilities; and the remnant portion if any, can be claimed as refund in the bank account of the taxpayer according to the statute.    TDS and TCS Mechanism The concepts of TDS and TCS are often viewed in relation to direct taxes. But from the inception of GST, the concepts of TDS and TCS have also been introduced under the Indian indirect tax system. Whenever supplies of goods or services are made to any establishment of the Central or State Governments, agencies of the Government, local authorities or categories of persons who are notified and the contract value of such supplies of goods or services exceeds two lakh and fifty thousand rupees, then the governmental establishment or agency or local authority or notified category of persons are required to deduct TDS at the rate of one percent and deposit such GST amount deducted within ten days and, thus, become the deductor of TDS. The supplier of goods or services is then entitled to claim the credit of TDS which is paid by the deductor in its electronic cash ledger and, thus, becomes the deductee. Although the mechanism of TDS credit is similar to input tax credit, the core difference is that input tax credit is received in the electronic credit ledger whereas TDS credit is received in the electronic cash ledger. The electronic cash ledger is a ledger where deposits from the taxpayer’s bank account are reflected, and the taxpayer is entitled to either pay its output liability of GST from the cash ledger or adjust the available input tax credit from the credit ledger. The TCS mechanism is applicable for electronic commerce operators, and they are required to deduct TCS at the rate of one percent and deposit it to the Government treasury within ten days. The supplier of goods or service who has made such supplies through the electronic commerce operator is eligible to claim credit of the TCS paid by the electronic commerce operator, in its electronic cash ledger.       [Continued in Part 2] – Manohar Samal Interpretation of statutes Taxation"

            "Identification of Related Parties of Subsidiaries By GuestFebruary 16, 20237 Min read1 comment   [Aisha Begum Ansari is a Manager at Vinod Kothari and Company]  The provisions pertaining to related party transactions (RPT) under the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (the ‘LODR Regulations’) were substantially amended by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on November 9, 2021. Pursuant to the amendments, the definitions of a related party, material RPT, requirements of obtaining audit committee and shareholders’ approval were altered. The definition of ‘RPT’ was amended to include cross-RPTs. Earlier, only transactions between the listed entity and its related parties were covered, but now the following transactions are also covered:  Transactions between a listed entity and its related parties; Transaction between the subsidiaries of the listed entity and its related parties; Transaction between the listed entity and related parties of subsidiaries; Transaction between subsidiaries and related parties of listed entity; Transaction between subsidiaries and related parties of other subsidiaries.  In order to identify the RPTs and to obtain requisite approvals, the listed entity is first required to identify its related parties and share their details with its subsidiaries. Similarly, the subsidiaries are required to identify their related parties and share them with the listed entity and other subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are also required to track the RPTs at their level on an ongoing basis, to check if the value of their RPTs exceeds the threshold limits requiring audit committee or shareholders’ approval of the listed entity. Therefore, to carry out the implementation of the RPT framework at the holding company level, the subsidiaries are also required to identify their related parties. Now, a question arises as to which definition of related party should be followed by the subsidiaries. The subsidiary can be a listed subsidiary or an unlisted subsidiary. An unlisted subsidiary prepares its list of related parties according to section 2(76) of the Companies Act, 2013 as the LODR Regulations do not apply to them. However, for the purpose of compliance of regulation 23 by the listed parent, should the unlisted subsidiary continue providing the list of related parties only in accordance with the Companies Act, or should it prepare another more holistic list of related parties as per each of the clauses of reg. 2(1)(zb) of the LODR Regulations? Further, if the subsidiary is in a foreign jurisdiction, should it follow the law of the Indian holding company or the law of the country in which the subsidiary is incorporated? The law, as of now, is not clear on this. Hence, there is a possibility of varied interpretations. One interpretation is to identify related parties in accordance with the law applicable to the LODR Regulations. However, on the other side, it might be possible to say that related parties of subsidiaries should be identified as per the law applicable to them. This post seeks to analyse the highlights and challenges of each of the above options. Option 1: Identifying related parties as per the LODR Regulations Option 1 applies an entity-agnostic definition across the parent as well as all its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries may be Indian unlisted companies, or overseas entities. The definition of related party under reg. 2(1)(zb) of the LODR Regulations is quite comprehensive and means:  related parties defined under section 2(76) of the Companies Act, 2013; related parties defined under the applicable accounting standards; any person or entity forming a part of the promoter or promoter group of the listed entity; any person or any entity holding equity shares of 20% or more (10% or more, with effect from April 1, 2023) in the listed entity either directly or on a beneficial interest basis as provided under section 89 of the Companies Act, 2013, at any time, during the immediately preceding financial year.  Merits If the subsidiary follows the laws as applicable to the listed parent entity i.e., the LODR Regulations, it will be required to identify the related parties applying the definition given in regulation 2(1)(zb) thereof. The advantage of following the definition in the LODR Regulations by the subsidiary is that there is a consistency of definition used by both entities. There is a common template, consisting of items (1), (2), (3) and (4) above which is circulated to all the subsidiaries. The subsidiaries fill the common templates, and that is how the RPTs at the level of the subsidiaries are identified. In essence, for the identification of related parties as well as RPTs, there is a common group-wide definition. As such, there will be consistency in the law followed by the entire group, making the implementation of the RPT framework, right from the identification of related parties to approval and disclosure requirements, easier at the parent level. Demerits If we closely examine the definition of related parties under regulation 2(1)(zb), we obtain a different view. The parties covered under the proviso (i.e., promoter and promoter group or entities holding shares on a beneficial interest basis) specifically refer to listed entities – therefore, these are not relevant for unlisted subsidiaries, or subsidiaries outside India. As for applicable accounting standards, it very clearly seems to be referring to standards applicable to the entity in question and, therefore, an entity-agnostic approach does not seem implied there. In case of overseas entities, ‘applicable accounting standards’ will obviously mean accounting standards as may be applicable to the entity and, therefore, entity-specific accounting standards. The only clause which is, therefore, left to be applied is the definition under the Companies Act, 2013. That definition applies to both listed and unlisted companies in India. However, such an extension by exported jurisdictions may create complexity for the subsidiaries incorporated outside India. At times, the terminology used in foreign jurisdictions are not the same as that used in India. For example, terms such “relative” (a part of the definition of related party) may have a completely different meaning in various jurisdictions. Further, the definition of “subsidiary” or “associate’ may also be different. As a result, there is a strong possibility of inaccuracy or irreconcilability in the list of related parties provided by such foreign subsidiaries. Option 2: Identifying related parties as per the applicable laws Option 2 lets each company define related parties based on the definition applicable to it. There may or may not be analogous controls on RPTs, but clearly, accounting standards are almost the same all over the countries that matter. Since a part of the definition of related party even under the LODR Regulations refers to ‘applicable accounting standards’, if we are using the definition as per accounting standards of the jurisdiction, we are serving the requirement of the law. Besides, going by the respective laws as applicable to the subsidiaries would be more convenient for the subsidiaries, as they would anyways maintain the list of related parties to comply with its applicable law. Closing remarks Based on the analysis above, it can be said that there can be two possible approaches. One, the listed entity requires the subsidiaries to maintain and provide the list of related parties as per the LODR Regulations. Alternatively, subsidiaries may be allowed to share the list of related parties maintained according to their respective local laws. The LODR Regulations, at present, do not provide ample clarity on the approach to be followed. Nor is there any guidance issued by the regulator so far. Therefore, neither of the said approaches can be said to be non-compliant. Hence, the listed entities may take a considered call to go by any of the options. In our view, allowing subsidiaries to prepare the list by their local laws may be more convenient. – Aisha Begum Ansari Company Law Corporate Governance SEBI"

            "Bombay High Court Reiterates Distinction Between Forward Contracts and Options in Securities By Umakanth VarottilFebruary 13, 20238 Min readAdd comment   The distinction between a forward contract for sale and purchase of securities in a company on the one hand and the creation of an option in relation to such securities on the other hand bears considerable relevance when it comes to their enforceability. While the Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act, 1956 (SCRA) and various notifications issued therein by the Central Government as well as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) proscribed forward contracts, they had (at least implicitly) been somewhat lenient towards options, although the erstwhile legal position had been somewhat fragmented and ambiguous. It is only in 2013 that SEBI clarified matters and shone the green light to options contained in shareholders’ agreements or articles of association of companies. Forward Contract or Option? Relevance of the Distinction I had the opportunity to analyze the pre-2013 legal position in the following excerpts from an article published in the NUJS Law Review in 2011: “Forward contracts are firm arrangements for purchase and sale of securities at a future date at a predetermined price. In such contracts, the seller is bound to sell and the purchaser is bound to purchase, with the only condition being the lapse of time. Neither party is entitled to make any decision whether to perform the contract (or not), and hence a “contract for the purchase and sale of securities” can be said to have come into existence at the time of execution of the contract itself. On the other hand, an option is a different type of contract. An option only provides an entitlement to purchase or sell securities. An option holder may either exercise the option, or allow it to lapse, depending on the circumstances. A firm contract for purchase and sale, which creates a legally binding purchase and sale obligation, arises only when the option is exercised in accordance with the terms of the contract. The obligation to purchase and sell comes into existence upon the occurrence of a contingency, which is the exercise of the option; an option can at best be a contingent contract. Hence, in this case, a “contract for the purchase and sale of securities” can be said to come into existence only upon the exercise of the option, and not prior to that when the option contract itself is entered into. So long as the transfer is com­pleted (through actual delivery of securities and payment of price) either on the day the option is exercised or the following day, it should qualify as a “spot delivery contract”, and therefore permissible within §16 of the SCRA and the SEBI notification. According to this analysis, a forward contract will fall within the proscription of §16 of the SCRA and the SEBI notification, while an option should stay outside their scope.” [footnotes omitted] This same issue involving a pre-2013 scenario came up in a decision of the division bench of the Bombay High Court in Percept Finserve Private Limited v. Edelweiss Financial Services Limited (2 February 2023). Under a share purchase agreement dated 8 December 2007 (SPA), Edelweiss purchased shares held by Percept Finserve in Percept Limited. The bone of contention related to the following clauses in the SPA: “8.5.    In the event of non-fulfillment of the first Condition Subsequent, the Investor shall have the right to: 8.5.1.   Re-sell share Shares held by it to the Seller or its Affiliates and the Seller is bound to purchase the same, at a price which would give the Investor an internal rate of return of 10% on the Purchase Consideration; or 8.5.2.   Continue as a Shareholder of the Company, subject to the following undertaking from the Seller: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx” Effectively, the aforesaid clauses were put in place to ensure that Percept Finserve performed certain conditions subsequent that were imposed on it in the SPA. The failure on the part of Percept Finserve would give Edelweiss two options, either to (i) sell the shares it purchased back to Percept Finserve at an internal rate of return of 10%, or (ii) to retain the shareholding in the company. If Edelweiss exercised the first option, it would create a binding obligation on Percept Finserve to purchase those shares at the agreed price. On the facts, since Percept Finserve failed to satisfy the conditions subsequent in the SPA, Edelweiss exercised the option to require a purchase of the shares in accordance with clause 8.5.1 above. Upon its Percept Finserve’s failure to purchase the shares, Edelweiss invoked arbitration before a sole arbitrator who rejected Edelweiss’s claim on the ground that the clause was illegal and unenforceable, being in breach of the SCRA. Edelweiss challenged the award before a single judge of the Bombay High Court who found that clauses 8.5 and 8.5.1 were perfectly legal and that there was no prohibition on the exercise of the option by Edelweiss. It is against this order that Percept Finserve preferred an appeal to a division bench of the same Court. The division bench expressed complete agreement with the views of the single judge in holding that the option contained in clauses 8.5 and 8.5.1 are legal and enforceable. The Court placed reliance on a previous discussion in MCX Stock Exchange v. SEBI, which recognized the distinction between an option (which was permitted) and a forward contract (which was prohibited). MCX too related to an option available to a purchaser of securities to require the vendor thereof to repurchase the securities upon the happening of a contingency. Hence, there was no present obligation in this case on Percept Finserve to purchase the shares from Edelweiss, which obligation arose only upon a contingency which, in this case, was non-compliance with the conditions subsequent. The contract for a sale and purchase of securities would come into effect only after two conditions are satisfied, namely (i) that Percept Finserve has failed to satisfy the conditions subsequent in the SPA, and (ii) Edelweiss has chosen to exercise its option to require Percept Finserve to purchase its shares at a 10% internal rate of return. Hence, it is clear that the distinction between a forward contact and option struck at the heart of whether the relevant clauses were enforceable or not. Status of Options Under Section 18A, SCRA Another question that came up before the Bombay High Court was whether the options contained in the SPA were contrary to section 18A of the SCRA. In the NUJS Law Review article referred to above, I had a chance to elaborate on the implications of options under this provision: “SEBI has sought to outlaw options on the ground that they contra­vene §18A of the SCRA, which provides that derivatives are valid only if they are entered into on stock exchanges. The argument proceeds on the basis that since options in customary investment agreements are exclusively entered into between the parties (on an “over-the-counter” basis) without trading or settle­ment on the stock exchange, they violate §18A. This approach, however, is not consistent with the overall frame­work of the SCRA. At the outset, the legislative intention behind the inclusion of §18A is clear: it was intended only to overcome the challenge that derivatives (such as options in securities) may constitute wager.  It has no impact on the enforceability or otherwise of derivatives in general and options in particular. Furthermore, the question of wager and therefore the relevance of §18A do not arise in the case of physically settled options, the type that is the subject matter of this paper. In such a physically settled option, one party agrees to grant to the other party an option (put or call) over securities. It only involves the creation of an option. §18A on the other hand deals with trading in derivatives (which presumably includes options). At most, the relevance of §18A can arise when an option holder seeks to sell the option (as opposed to the underlying shares) to another party. In such a case, the subject matter of the sale would be the option (namely the right to buy or sell shares) and not the shares themselves. Since physically settled options in customary investment contracts involve the creation of options, and not trading in options, there is no bar against such contracts being entered into and implemented outside the stock exchange. This fine jurisprudential distinction has not received the attention it deserves.” [footnotes omitted] In the case in discussion, the distinction between creation of an option and trading in an option did receive attention, where the conclusion of the Court follows the similar reasoning discussed above. The Court notes that “[s]imply making a put option concerning a security cannot be termed illegal and that too under the provisions of Section 18 of SCRA” [paragraph 20], as such a contract does not amount to a derivative and was never prohibited. For this reason too, the validity of clauses 8.5 and 8.5.1 cannot be impugned. Conclusion The Court in Percept Finserve was concerned with an important issue on corporate and securities law jurisprudence relating to the distinction between a forward contract and option. This distinction has significant implications on the enforceability of specific clauses in contractual arrangements such as share purchase agreements and shareholders’ agreements. While the case relates to the pre-2013 position, and the SEBI notification in that year clears the air as to options in several types of commercial transactions, the distinction becomes nevertheless crucial to ensure certainty and clarity of implementation of the provisions of the SCRA. To that extent, the Bombay High Court’s ruling performs the role of settling any controversy by reemphasizing the required conceptual clarity on concepts such as forward contracts and options in securities.

        "read_on_content": [
            "Liability of Company Secretary for Misstatements: SC Remits Case to SAT By Umakanth VarottilFebruary 11, 20233 Min readAdd comment   In November 2022, we had discussed a somewhat curious ruling of the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in V. Shankar v. Securities and Exchange Board of India which exonerated the Company Secretary of Deccan Chronicle Holdings Limited (DHCL) from liability for certain misstatements and incorrect disclosures made by the company. We had noted that the SAT largely arrived at the ruling on first principles and did not refer to the appropriate statutory principles or engage in any jurisprudential analysis, which may have pointed in the opposite direction. Now, on appeal, the Supreme Court in Securities and Exchange Board of India v. V. Shankar[1] set aside the order of the SAT and restored the matter to the file of the SAT for further consideration. Given that the Supreme Court decided to remit the matter, it too did not delve into the substantive issues, except for one. It relates to regulation 19(3) of the SEBI (Buyback of Securities) Regulations, 1998, which reads as follows: “The company shall nominate a compliance officer and investor service centre for compliance with the buy-back regulations and to redress the grievances of the investors.” The Court noted that the regulation placed two separate obligations on the company secretary, the first to ensure compliance with the regulations, and the second to redressing the grievances of investors. It found that the SAT had erred in confining the role of the company secretary to the second obligation, namely investor grievance redressal, and omitted to take cognizance of the first, rather broader, obligation. Apart from the this, the Court refused to be drawn into further details of either the facts or the case law, and clarified that the rights and contentions of the parties are kept open for the further consideration by the SAT, which must endeavour to decide the case within six months. The Supreme Court’s ruling does not at all come as a surprise. The SAT ruling was not only devoid of detailed analysis of the legal position, but it also went against the grain of conventional jurisprudence on the topic. The SAT must now take up the opportunity to clarify the liability of the company secretary under corporate and securities laws more comprehensively. As alluded to in our previous post, the role of the company secretary has acquired greater proportions under newer legislation such as the Companies Act, 2013, which follow a compliance-based approach by pinning significant responsibility on key officers of the company and external gatekeepers such as auditors. A clear articulation of the liability principles will enable the compliance officers and gatekeepers to perform their role more optimally and also provide certainty on the extent to which various stakeholders can rely on their disclosures.   [1] Hat-tip: Gaurav Pingle, Company Secretary.

            "Necessity of Judicial Member in the CCI: NCLAT’S Perplexing Piece of the Puzzle By GuestFebruary 11, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Shourya Mitra is a penultimate year law student at Jindal Global Law School, Sonipat] Recently, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) dismissed the appeals filed by United Breweries and others against the order of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) (Beer Cartel Case). The CCI had held that the beer companies were in contravention of the provisions of the Competition Act 2002 (Act) by cartelizing amongst themselves. While dismissing the appeals, the NCLAT firmly observed that the coram of the Commission did not require the presence of a judicial member as there is no such requirement in the Act. This post will attempt to locate the stand taken by the NCLAT in the broader legal setting and analyse its impact. The Brief Facts of the Case and the Concerned Ratio The CCI had taken cognizance of the case via a leniency application filed by one of the companies. After hearing the parties, the Commission had imposed a penalty of Rs. 870 crores on the various beer companies for cartelizing. The NCLAT was hearing an appeal against this order, and one of the grounds raised by the Appellants was based on the absence of a Judicial member in the coram of the CCI. It was argued that in the absence of a Judicial Member, the order of the CCI should be interfered with and set aside. The NCLAT dismissed this argument by perusing sections 8 and 9 of the Act, which deal with the composition of the CCI and the selection of its members, respectively. On perusing the provisions, it held that there is no mandatory requirement to have a Judicial member for deciding a proceeding, and stated that “if a statute speaks to do it in a particular manner that has to be done in the same manner not in other way”. The NCLAT, while giving this decision, did not rely upon any material beyond the provisions of the Act itself. Therefore, this piece will attempt to locate the ruling in the broader legal setting by analysing the following: (i) The legal backdrop favouring the presence of a judicial member; (ii) The legal backdrop against the presence of a judicial member; (iii) The interaction of the ruling with various competition law reports. The Legal Backdrop Favouring the Presence of a Judicial member  The Mahindra Electricity case is a landmark decision regarding the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Act. One of the issues therein was the constitutionality of section 8 of the Act, wherein it was alleged that the composition of CCI is unconstitutional and violates the principle of separation of powers. The Delhi High Court, while ruling on this issue, held that the CCI cannot be characterized as a tribunal solely discharging judicial functions owing to its various other roles, such as its administrative and expert roles. However, in line with the judgement given by the Apex Court in the Utility Users Welfare Association case, the Delhi High Court held that the CCI should, at all times, and especially during final orders, have a judicial member present. This would act as a safeguard against the executive-dominated selection process under section 9 of the Act as well. Unfortunately, the NCLAT, while ruling in the Beer Cartel case did not deliberate upon this decision of the Delhi High Court. Despite the decision in Mahindra Electricity being under challenge at the Apex Court, such a conclusive stand by the NCLAT may be detrimental to the proper functioning of the Commission, while also being contrary to the principle of judicial discipline. Further, having a judicial member may arguably be a fair mandate as following the principles of natural justice is an important facet to be considered by the CCI while giving decisions. The same is evident from section 36 of the Act, which states that the “Commission shall be guided by the principles of natural justice”. The Apex Court as well as the COMPAT have reiterated this in numerous cases. Several decisions have also been overturned due for violating principles of natural justice, such as in the Lafarge India case. Therefore, the presence of a judicial member may help alleviate these situations due to the experience and knowledge such a member holds, and may bring fairness to the proceedings. Further, the application of complex laws is something that can also be secured by having a judicial member present. The NCLAT could have chosen to take the route that it did in some of the other cases, such as Tyre Cartel andSahuwala Cylinders, wherein it refrained from commenting upon the coram argument, as the matter was sub-judicebefore the Apex Court. The Legal Backdrop Against the Presence of a Judicial Member The Delhi High Court, in the case of CADD Systems, held that the ruling in Mahindra Electricity cannot interdict the functioning of the CCI, pending the appointment of a judicial member. It also relied on section 15 of the Act, which states that mere defects in the composition of the CCI cannot invalidate its proceedings. The NCLAT, in the case of Amazon NV Holdings, also relied upon section 15 of the Act to hold that the lack of a judicial member is a defect in the composition, which cannot vitiate the entire proceeding. These two cases give the impression that the requirement of a judicial member is not a sine qua non. Unfortunately, the NCLAT in the Beer Cartel case, neither took recourse to section 15 of the Act, nor did it choose to rely on the decision in CADD Systems. Therefore, while the Beer Cartel ruling is in line with certain previous decisions, the jurisprudential basis of the decision itself does not feel limpid. The Interaction of the Ruling with Various Competition Law Reports The Raghavan Committee Report (Report), which is responsible for the inception of the Competition Act 2002, took a stand that would be in favour of the Beer Cartel ruling of the NCLAT. The Report explicitly stated that the judiciary may be inexperienced to deal with free market problems which is why the need for a specialized body like the CCI was suggested. The acknowledgement of the inexperience is indicative of the fact that the judiciary, and consequently, judicial members may not be the mandatory or preferred persons for constituting the CCI. Conversely, the 2019 report of the Competition Law Review Committee, acknowledged the Mahindra Electricitydecision mandating the presence of a judicial member, and suggested that necessary action may be considered by the Central Government. Similarly, the Standing Committee on Finance released its 52nd Report last month, wherein it also discussed the presence of judicial member in the coram. It reflected on various suggestions from different stakeholders, which suggested that CCI must have judicial members owing to the adjudicatory functions it performs. On the other hand, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs suggested that the statute does not mention the appointment of a judicial member specifically, and should be interpreted accordingly. Conclusion On a balancing exercise, the answer to the judicial member puzzle seems to be leaning towards the inclusion of a judicial member in the coram. While section 15 of the Act forms a convincing basis for not necessitating the presence, it should not override the strong arguments in favour of carrying out the well settled principles of natural justice, which can be ensured by the presence of a judicial member. Further, the Mahindra Electricity ruling is valid in law until the Apex Court takes a stand to the contrary. The ruling is also supported by the Report of the Competition Law Review Committee, which recommends that the Central Government to take necessary action. The NCLAT, while making the observation with respect to the presence of a judicial member, could have deliberated upon the pre-existing jurisprudence, both in favour and against, to help clarify the position of law. It could also have chosen to refrain from conclusively deciding the issue, in line with its decisions in Tyre Cartel and Sahuwala cylinders cases. Further, the NCLAT also could have relied upon section 15 of the Act, and held that the defective composition does not make the orders of the CCI void. Unfortunately, the NCLAT did not deliberate over the cases discussed above in reaching its conclusions. This firm holding by the NCLAT can possibly muddle the already convoluted legal state of the issue. We now have to await the decision of the Apex Court for conclusive settlement of the issue, which is presently sub-judice. At present, the CCI has two members, and both of the members have a non-judicial background. – Shourya Mitra"

        "read_on_content": [
            "Imposition of an Interim Moratorium Prior to Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process By GuestFebruary 10, 20238 Min read1 comment   [Sumer Karekar is a lawyer and is presently undergoing the Graduate Insolvency Programme at the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs, Gurgaon] The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”) has sought to implement a time-bound framework for resolution of stressed companies. For this purpose, it prescribes a timeline for the adjudicating authority (“AA”) to admit or reject an application for corporate insolvency resolution process (“CIRP”). However, in practice, there have been excessive delays in the pre-admission stage, thereby resulting in unfavourable outcomes. Considering this scenario, it becomes relevant to discuss the imposition of an interim moratorium upon filing a CIRP application to meet the objectives of the IBC. This post analyses the problems arising during the pre-admission stage of the CIRP, and considers whether an interim moratorium in the pre-admission stage is a viable solution. In doing so, it explores the available jurisprudence on interim moratorium under the Singaporean insolvency framework and discusses the implementation of such a mechanism under the IBC. Problems Plaguing the Pre-Admission Stage The IBC imposes an automatic moratorium after commencement of the CIRP under section 14, and empowers the interim resolution professional (“IRP”) to take control of the assets of the corporate debtor. Notably, sections 7(4), 9(5), and 10(4) require the AA to admit or reject a CIRP application within 14 days of its filing. However, in practice, the pre-admission stage is prone to inordinate delays. The findings of a 2021 IBBI Survey on CIRP Timelines suggested that, on an average, the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) took 133 days from the date of filing to decide a CIRP application, as opposed to the prescribed 14-day timeline. It also found that reducing delays in the pre-admission stage would be a key factor for successful CIRPs, according to the responses gathered from various resolution professionals. For example, in Techno Electric & Engineering Co. Ltd. v. McLeod Russel India Ltd., the applicant was compelled to approach the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (“NCLAT”) after the CIRP application dated July 8, 2019 was left unattended for almost seven months due to shortage of judges. Such delays may work to the advantage of errant promoters whose actions or omissions may dilute the value of the assets of the corporate debtor, thereby, directly threatening the objectives of the IBC. Precedents on the Pre-admission Moratorium in India  The Insolvency Law Committee (ILC) Report 2020 noticed the delays in the pre-admission stage, which extended beyond six months in some cases. For instance, in Asset Reconstruction Company Limited v. GPT Steel Industries Limited, Company Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) No. 151 of 2019, the section 7 admission remained at the adjudication stage for more than a year. In this regard, the Committee found that:  prolonged delay may incentivise siphoning of assets by promoters; and creditors of the corporate debtor may attempt to enforce their debts in this period.  To tackle these issues, the Committee recommended the imposition of an ‘interim moratorium’ upon the filing of an application for initiation of CIRP. Interestingly, in NUI Pulp and Paper Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. Roxcel Trading GMBH, the NCLAT upheld an interim order of the NCLT (Chennai), where it prohibited the corporate debtor and its directors from alienating, encumbering or creating any third-party interests on its assets, until the admission or rejection of the application. This order was made based on an apprehension of the creditors that the corporate debtor intended on transferring its assets. The NCLT found that the apprehension was reasonable, and imposed a pre-admission moratorium – in exercise of its inherent powers under rule 11 of the NCLT Rules, 2016. Likewise, in F.M. Hammerle Textiles Limited, the corporate debtor filed a section 10 application after receiving letters from creditors seeking to initiate action for recovery of dues. The adjudicating authority directed the applicant to cure defects in the application, and granted “an interim moratorium in terms of Section 14 of the IBC”. It appears that the NCLAT has deemed it necessary to impose an interim moratorium in circumstances where it believed there to be a reasonable apprehension of misappropriation of assets, even though it has been in merely two cases. This adds to the need for a mechanism to prevent siphoning of assets during the pre-admission stage. Interim Moratorium under the Singaporean Insolvency Law The Singaporean framework is governed by the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (“IRDA”), which provides for judicial management of a company. Section 93 of the Act empowers the courts to restrict the performance of any act or exercise of any powers of the company, or disposal of any assets of the company, except in ordinary course of business. The court may also prohibit transfer of shares, or alteration of the rights of any members of the company. Such restrictions may be imposed for a specified time period, and the court may appoint an “interim judicial manager” under the IRDA for supervision. Further, from the Report of the Insolvency Law Review Committee of Singapore (2013), it appears that the interim moratorium provision in the IRDA was crucial because the relevant look-back period for avoidance transactions extends backwards from the date of filing the application, and not from the date of admission. While the look-back period for avoidance transactions under the IBC begins from the insolvency commencement date, imposing pre-admission restrictions on the corporate debtor, akin to those in the IRDA, can provide an additional layer of protection over its assets. Analysis: Application and Scope of a Pre-admission Moratorium Whether Automatic or Discretionary In this regard, the ILC Report recommended that the power to impose such moratorium should be within the discretion of the adjudicating authority, where it deems it urgent and necessary in light of meeting the objectives of IBC. Additionally, it found that the interim moratorium may include all or any of the situations envisaged under section 14 of the IBC, based on the facts of the case, which would allow a smooth transition into the moratorium after admission. However, such a discretionary interim moratorium may add to the pre-existing causes for delay, i.e. case backlog and judicial procedure. Therefore, an automatic interim moratorium may be considered. Notably, the MCA Discussion Paper dated January 18, 2023 has proposed involving information utilities (“IUs”) in the ascertainment of default before filing a CIRP application, to streamline the admission process and remove delays. Herein, the IUs shall verify evidence of default with the available financial records, and direct the corporate debtor to authenticate it within a given time-period. Upon lapse of this period, the information shall be deemed authenticated, thereby establishing default.  Such ascertainment would be considered “conclusive proof about the occurrence of default”. Therefore, this proposed change can support the automatic commencement of the interim moratorium, from the date of filing the CIRP application (upon service of notice to the corporate debtor). Imposition of Restrictions on the Corporate Debtor Given that the main issue, as observed above, is the misappropriation of assets by promoters during the pre-admission stage, the interim moratorium should selectively restrict the corporate debtor’s activities. Taking key aspects from the IRDA and section 14 of the IBC, it shall impose statutory restrictions on: (a)        alienation or disposal of the assets of the corporate debtor; (b)        transfer of shares in the debtor; (c)        creation of third-party interest on the debtor’s assets; and (d)       initiation of any legal action by creditors, including under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Additionally, these restrictions would require certain exceptions, wherein the management is enabled to transact in the ordinary course of business, while maintaining detailed records of such transactions conducted during this period. Duration The ILC suggested a 60-day interim moratorium in its 2020 Report. However, in case the time taken for adjudication extends beyond 60 days, another application would have to be made to the adjudication authority, thereby defeating the purpose of the automatic stay. For this reason, the interim moratorium should continue until admission or rejection of the CIRP, as seen in NUI Pulp and Paper Industries. Conclusion According to the findings of a 2022 Survey in an IBBI Publication, more than 60% of respondents agreed that most promoters attempt to misappropriate assets prior to the admission of the CIRP. In consideration of the above, it is argued that the “interim moratorium” idea takes birth from two issues, i.e. the prolonged pre-admission period, and the possibility of siphoning of assets by promoters. Additionally, the heavy judicial backlog warrants an automatic interim moratorium. Regardless of this idea, certain disadvantages and barriers cannot be ignored. Genuine businesses may face trouble due to the restrictions imposed. Moreover, given the delay in the pre-admission stage, the interim moratorium could run indefinitely. However, in the present-day insolvency landscape, an interim moratorium with selective restrictions on the corporate debtor shall be beneficial until the problem of judicial backlog is solved. Especially with the proposed changes to the IBC in relation to the role of IUs in ascertaining default, such a mechanism can effectively safeguard the objectives of the IBC. – Sumer Karekar Insolvency"

            "Derivative Action – Where Does the Jurisdiction Lie? By GuestFebruary 7, 202311 Min readAdd comment   [Pratyush Singh is a third-year student at the National Law School of India University, Bangalore] Does the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) have exclusive jurisdiction over matters pertaining to derivative action? In November 2022, the Madras High Court in Valluvar Kuzhumam Pvt. Ltd. v. APC Drilling & Construction Pvt. Ltd. ruled in the affirmative. The argument to bar a civil court’s jurisdiction in a derivative action suit has been brought up several times before but the courts never reached a verdict owing to the plaint getting rejected for other reasons. Thus, Valluvar Kuzhumam is a significant development in corporate law jurisprudence. It is in this broad context that this post argues that the NCLT should not have jurisdiction over derivative suits. To that end, the post will, first, present the requirements of barring a civil remedy and how the court in Valluvar Kuzhumam reached that conclusion, second, argue why shareholder derivative action should not lie under the Companies Act, and third, elaborate on the ramifications of the findings. Establishing Exclusive Jurisdiction of the NCLT How does the civil court lose its jurisdiction over a category of cases? This is a question that gained immense relevance ever since the rise in tribunalisation in India. Dhulabhai v. State of Madhya Pradesh is a seminal case that established seven principles through which one can assess if the jurisdiction of the civil courts is barred. In essence, it had to be proved that, first, a statute provided finality to the orders of the said tribunal and, second, that there was an express bar on the civil court’s jurisdiction under the statute which would also be supplemented by adequate remedies that a tribunal could grant. Section 430 of the Companies Act, 2013 prohibits civil courts from having jurisdiction over any matters that the Act confers to the NCLT or the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). In Sas Hospitality v. Surya Constructions, the Delhi High Court was called upon to comment on the exclusivity of the NCLT’s jurisdiction under section 430. The Court observed that under sections 241 and 242 the NCLT has broad powers which allow it to pass any “such order as it thinks fit.” This means that even if a civil court had jurisdiction over such company matters, it would not have the authority to pass orders to the extent the NCLT can. The Court thus concluded that the instant case would come within the domain of the NCLT. The issue that arises here is that the ratio of Sas Hospitality severely limited its scope by restricting its application to only cases dealing with the need to restrict the allotment of shares. What this entails is a case-by-case analysis for every matter to determine if the remedy sought by the plaintiff is provided under the Companies Act. Thus, there are instances where the court may conclude that since the Companies Act is inadequate to provide relief to the plaintiff, they can file a civil suit instead of approaching the NCLT. For example, in Bakshi Faiz Ahmad v. Bakshi Farooq Ahmad, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court held that since NCLT does not have the power to decide on serious issues of fraud and collusion, a civil court can be duly approached. This brings us to Valluvar Kuzhumam. The Court in this case stated that section 241 empowers ‘any member’ to complain against an action in the ‘the interest of the company’, while section 242 provides the NCLT the authority to deal with section 241 applications. In the Court’s opinion, these provisions encompassed everything there was to a shareholder derivative action suit. Hence, as the Companies Act provided remedies for the said contention, the Court concluded that the jurisdiction of a civil court would be barred. The next section briefly discusses the jurisprudence of derivative action in India to understand its requirements. Evolution of Shareholder Derivative Action in India  Since the derivative action in India not codified and is, instead, rooted in common law, it is important to briefly discuss its origins. Foss v. Harbottle (1843) 2 Hare 461 set the foundation for one of the earliest corporate law principles, i.e., the proper plaintiff rule. This rule states that if a particular wrong has been committed against a company, then only the company has the locus to bring an action and not a shareholder. Almost a century later, Edwards v. Halliwell 1950 (1) All ER 1064 carved out three exceptions to Foss v. Harbottle. Jenkins LJ stated that the majority in a company cannot ratify acts that are either ultra vires, or which require a qualified majority or acts that constitute a fraud against the minority. This act of a shareholder suing on behalf of the company is called derivative action. It arises in cases where the wrongdoers are in positions of power (or are the majority shareholders), and are thus unlikely to bring a suit on behalf of the company against their own interests. Indian courts in various decisions had accepted this common law derivative action under the existing corporate law jurisprudence. However, the Delhi High Court in ICP Investments (Mauritius) Ltd v Uppal Housing Pvt Ltd (previously discussed here) completely changed this settled law. The Court ruled that section 241(1) of the Companies Act would encompass derivative action. The rationale of the court is that section 241 allows a member of the company to file a petition when the affairs of the company are conducted in a way that is prejudicial to the company’s interest. The Court further went ahead to state that since section 241 now subsumes derivative action, its common law remedy (at least to the extent that the oppression and mismanagement provision is equipped to handle) will cease to exist. It is the same understanding that the Court in Valluvar Kuzhumam seems to rely upon. Now since both the major requirements mentioned in Dhulabhai were fulfilled, i.e., an explicit bar under section 430 and adequate remedies under section 242, the Court concluded that the civil court’s jurisdiction for derivative actions would be barred. Futility of Locating Derivative Action under the Companies Act This section attempts to establish that no provisions under the Companies Act contain the concept of derivative action as formulated by the earlier common law jurisprudence. Section 241 The earlier section of this post would suggest that the Indian courts see merit in the idea of reading derivative action within section 241 of the Companies Act. This post argues to the contrary. The Court failed to acknowledge the differences between a corporate wrong and a personal wrong. Under a derivative action, since it is the company that has suffered a wrong (corporate wrong), the remedies are directed toward the company. However, a claim under section 241 can also be brought to enforce a personal right for a claim of oppression and mismanagement. What this entails is an argument that states that the interests of the company and shareholders are the same. This argument breaks one of the corporate law’s core tenets of treating a company as a separate legal personability. It must further be noted that there is also a lack of legislative intent when arguing that derivative action comes under section 241. The erstwhile Companies Act had two different sections for oppression and mismanagement. Section 398 of the erstwhile Act had almost the same phrasing (“[affairs conducted] prejudicial to the interests of the company”) as section 241 of the 2013 Act. However, previous jurisprudence would suggest that sections 397 and 398 were expressly interpreted to mean that they do not contain any cause for a derivative action suit. The 2013 Act consolidated the two sections but made the prejudice remedy available for wrongs caused to the shareholders as well as the company. It is interesting to note that the original Companies Bill only provided this remedy in the context of harms caused to the shareholder. It was the Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who in their memorandum, recommended adding the phrase “in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the company.” This proposal was later accepted by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. There is no other deliberation linked to the addition of this phrase. In such a situation, how does one interpret a provision that in a way provides for corporate as well as private wrongs? One author argues that the addition of the phrase may be the Parliament borrowing from Singapore jurisprudence. The Singapore Courts have noticed that there may be instances where a case for oppression/mismanagement where during the course of inquiry, it is revealed that the company has also suffered an incidental harm. Thus, it would still not amount to a suit for derivative action owing to a direct action being the primary reason for its existence. The remedies for corporate and personal wrongs are completely different and hence cannot be presumed to be conflated by the legislature. Section 245 Although never used by courts, various academics have considered that section 245 of the Companies Act may be a more suitable provision to fit a shareholder derivative action suit. Regardless of its resemblance, it is argued that section 245 does not encompass derivate action suits for three reasons. First, section 245 is provision providing for class action suits. However, it must be noted that even section 245 is filed by either members or depositors on behalf of other members or depositors, and not on behalf of the company. Second, a single shareholder is allowed to bring a derivative action; however, under section 245, the members or depositors need to form a numerical ‘class’ before being able to file a suit. And third, almost all of the remedies are directed toward the company instead of being available to the company for relief. Thus, the overall structure of section 245 is starkly different from a derivative action provision. Even the Calcutta High Court in The Punjab Produce & Trading Co Pvt Ltd v Pilani Investment & Industries Corp Ltd accepted that derivative action does not fall within the scope of section 245. Lastly, it is pertinent to note that the legislature expressly rejected the inclusion of a provision for derivative action. The only rationale provided was that it is a new concept that should not be inserted in a hurried manner. By rejecting the concept of derivative actions during deliberations, the legislature clearly never intended to include it in section 241 or section 245. Thus, any attempt by the judiciary to read derivative action into any of the provisions of the Companies Act would amount to an erroneous interpretation of the statute. Impact of Civil Court Jurisdiction Having established that a claim for derivative action is not present under the Companies Act, the logical conclusion one would reach is that the bar on the jurisdiction of civil courts thus does not exist. The obvious question now relates to what consequence this will carry. In order to be eligible to file a case under section 241, a member has to satisfy the conditions mentioned under section 244. Similarly, there are certain conditions that a member or a depositor has to fulfil under section 245 before they are eligible to file a class action suit. Since NCLT does not have exclusive jurisdiction over derivative suits, a person can approach a civil court without complying with any of the abovementioned conditions. In Cyrus Investments v. Tata Sons, the respondent counsel had argued that they would not have to fulfil the requirements under section 244 if they had filed their suit before a civil court. Although their argument was rejected owing to NCLAT holding that the allegation against them fit squarely within section 241, an important point can be derived from this. In a derivative action suit, which does not fall under the Companies Act, one can directly approach the civil courts for remedies by merely adhering to the earlier common law jurisprudence. Thus, if the legislature wishes to introduce certain requirements to avoid frivolous litigation under derivative actions, it should explicitly introduce a provision for it under the current Companies Act. Conclusion This post argued that the Court in Valluvar Kuzhumam erred in its judgment by locating derivative action under section 241. Derivative action has been intentionally and by design left out of the Companies Act. Until the time the legislature deems fit, it should not be read into any of the provisions, thus giving the NCLT exclusive jurisdiction over such matters. This would entail allowing a plaintiff to approach civil courts for seeking remedy under a derivative action suit without imposing additional requirements on them. – Pratyush Singh  Companies Act Company Law"

            "Bombay High Court’s ASREC Ruling: Form v. Substance in SARFAESI Proceedings By GuestFebruary 6, 20239 Min read1 comment   [Sharanya Shivaraman  is an Advocate practicing in Mumbai and a graduate of ILS Law College, Pune] The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 was enacted over two decades ago to facilitate loan recovery and the securitisation of financial assets of banks and financial institutions. Under the framework of the Act, section 13 is a key provision dealing with the enforcement of security interest (i.e. any interest created over property in favour of the secured creditor and includes mortgage, charge, hypothecation etc.). Section 13 provides that when a borrower of a secured loan defaults in repayment thereof, and his account in respect of such debt is classified as a non-performing asset, then the secured creditor may require the borrower, by a notice in writing, to discharge his liability within sixty days of the notice, failing which the secured creditor will be at liberty to take steps for taking possession and sale of the secured asset. It is, therefore, evident that the notice under section 13(2) (“13(2) Notice”) is the foundation for taking any steps/proceedings by the secured creditor. In a recent ruling by the Bombay High Court in ASREC (India) v. Fastgrowth Hospitality, the court laid down important principles on the issue of form versus substance of the 13(2) Notice. In this post, I examine the implications of this ruling for security enforcement proceedings under SARFAESI. Facts of the Case IIFL Wealth Finance Limited had extended certain financial facilities to Fastgrowth. Fastgrowth defaulted on the repayment of the said financial facilities as per the terms agreed between the parties. IIFL therefore filed a Commercial Suit before the Bombay High Court for recovering the outstanding loan amount. Thereafter, IIFL issued the a 13(2) Notice calling upon Fastgrowth to repay the then outstanding amount along with interest. In the meanwhile, the account of Fastgrowth was assigned by IIFL to ASREC (India) Ltd. In February 2022, ASREC filed an Application before the District Magistrate, Goa seeking assistance under section 14 of the Act to take physical possession of the secured assets situated in Goa. The District Magistrate allowed ASREC’s application. Pursuant to the District Magistrate’s Order, the Mamlatdar delegated the power to take possession to the ‘Head Clerk’ and scheduled a date for taking over the possession as well. Aggrieved by this, Fastgrowth preferred Securitisation Application No. 160 of 2022 before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (“DRT”), seeking interim and ad interim reliefs of injunction to restrain ASREC from taking any step in furtherance of the 13(2) Notice or the Order of the District Magistrate and the Mamlatdar. The DRT allowed the application granting interim relief to Fastgrowth and restraining ASREC from taking any further steps under SARFAESI. Pertinently, the DRT founded the relief on the following key grounds: First, that the Mamlatdar delegated the authority to take physical custody of the secured assets to the Head Clerk, which was legally impermissible; second, that the 13(2) Notice shows capitalization of penal interest; and third, that the 13(2) Notice does not provide a breakup of the principal interest, and penal interest sought to be recovered. The Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (“DRAT”) upheld the order passed by the DRT, restraining ASREC from taking steps as per the Act. Aggrieved by the above orders passed by DRT and DRAT, ASREC preferred a Writ Petition before the Bombay High Court. Interpretative Issues The High Court, while allowing the Writ Petition, made observations having wide implications on the interpretation of section 13 of the Act. At the outset, the DRT, DRAT and the High Court agreed that the power to take physical possession of the secured asset could not be sub-delegated by the Mamlatdar to the Head Clerk. However, the High Court disagreed with the decision of the DRT and DRAT to restrain ASREC on the sole ground that the Order of the Mamlatdar suffered from the abovementioned defect. The High Court held that if the sub-delegation was an impediment, the DRT could have passed appropriate orders cancelling sub-delegation or directed ASREC to do so. Interestingly, the High Court in paragraph 14 notes that “the Impugned Order does not record a finding that the Petitioner was instrumental in getting the sub-delegation done or had benefited from it”. By the said observation, the High Court has suggested that mere non-compliance with the provisions of the Act or the Rules framed thereunder, does not ipso facto render the entire order/proceeding unenforceable, and the DRT ought to not apply the mandate of the Act in a technical manner, but delve into whether the suggested illegality/non-compliance is intentionally caused or prejudices the parties in any manner whatsoever. A similar approach is seen towards the issue of capitalisation of penal interest. On this aspect, the High Court, upon examining the 13(2) Notice as well as the pleadings in the Commercial Suit preferred by ASREC prior to sending the 13(2) Notice, came to the conclusion that, in fact, there was no capitalisation of interest in the 13(2) Notice. The Court further observed that in any case, the outstanding amounts mentioned in the Commercial Suit and the 13(2) Notice were identical (despite passage of time in the interregnum). Therefore, the High Court concluded as follows: “…… The DRT has proceeded as if the moment legal argument is made by the borrower, no enquiry was necessary for grant of injunction and even admitted amounts can be ignored. The Tribunal could have called upon the Respondents to address it on the admitted amounts and as to why the Respondents should not be directed to deposit the same or substantial part thereof as a condition to injunct the Petitioner from proceeding further.” It is evident from the aforesaid paragraph that the High Court has added a layer of analysis and enquiry in the scheme of interim and ad interim proceedings. The High Court has indicated that mere departure from the statute may not be sufficient to tilt the equities in favour of the debtor. The High Court’s approach appears to emanate from the need to balance the interests of the creditor and the debtor. In the present case, as the debt or liability of the debtor was never disputed, the High Court was of the view that the debtor would not be entitled to unconditional protection from the Tribunal. Instead, the High Court indicated that the debtor’s interim protection from any action of the creditor, be made conditional, subject to the debtor making a deposit in the DRT. While there is no statutory requirement for a party to deposit any money, as a pre-condition to be entitled to interim relief, High Courts have often imposed such a condition on the petitioning party to balance the equities at the interim stage. The condition of pre-deposit is not alien to the SAFRAESI and debt recovery jurisprudence, with the Tribunals adopting the practice of the High Courts on a case to case basis. Albeit in a different context, Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, requires parties to deposit 50% of the amount claimed by the secured creditor/determined by the DRT as a pre-condition to appeal against the order of the DRT. Further, Fastgrowth raised an issue pertaining to the 13(2) Notice violating section 13(3) of the Act. As per section 13(3), the 13(2) Notice is required to provide the break-up of the principal and interest component of the outstanding dues mentioned therein. In the present case, the Notice admittedly did not provide for such breakup. The DRT, on the basis of the said non-compliance, granted relief to Fastgrowth. However, the High Court took an opposite view. The Court based its finding on the fact that Fastgrowth was aware of the principal and interest breakup and the detailed particulars of the outstanding dues, as the same were mentioned in the Commercial Suit filed before the High Court. The High Court stated that the aforesaid infirmity in the 13(2) Notice does not warrant an unconditional interim relief. Interestingly, the High Court goes a step further and hypothesizes a case where necessary particulars of the outstanding dues are intimated to the debtor a day before the issuance of the 13(2) Notice. In these circumstances as well, according to the High Court, non-compliance with Section 13(3) would not have fatal consequences. The High Court emphasised that the DRT ought to have examined the fact that the debt and liability were never disputed by the debtor. The High Court in paragraph 32, states that “before injuncting the Petitioner from proceeding as per law to recover the dues, the Tribunal was obliged to consider the implications of the arguments advanced by the Respondents on the final outcome of the application and whether it merited an unconditional interim order and in what manner equities could have been balanced.…...” Challenges  Broadly, the approach of DRT and DRAT stem from two factors viz. (a) DRT and DRAT being statutory tribunals, are strictly informed by the Act and the Rules framed thereunder and (b) banks and financial institutions being sophisticated commercial institutions cannot be exempt from knowing or following the letter of the law strictly. The significance of this judgment lies in the fact that the High Court has implored DRT and DRAT to travel beyond the strict mandate of the Act to examine the issues and equities at the interim stage. The High Court has clarified that mere non-compliance with a statutory mandate cannot entitle any party to relief if equities do not rest in their favour. However, the challenge in interpreting this judgment will perhaps arise due to the specialised nature of the Act. The Act provides for a specific procedure and strict timelines for any action taken in respect of a security interest. Departure from these procedures (for instance:- inadequacies in the notices intimating the debtor of take-over of possession/proposed auction of the secured assets etc.), invite judicial intervention to protect the interests of the debtor and ensure that no action is taken in respect of any property without due process of law. It is a well-established principle that if the law requires a thing to be done in particular way, it must be done in that way only. Therefore it remains to be seen how the DRT and DRAT will balance the potential infirmities in the security enforcement process, the impact such infirmities have on the interests of the debtor and the nature of protection to be granted to the debtor. – Sharanya Shivaraman  Banking Debt Finance"

            "Resolving the Conundrum Surrounding Applicability of Moratorium under Section(14)(1)(a) of IBC By GuestJanuary 27, 20238 Min read1 comment   [Kanishka Aswal and Ritik Jhanwar are III year students at the Gujarat National Law University, Gandhinagar. This post was first published here] One of the ultimate goals of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”) is to provide a mechanism for the timely resolution of a corporate debtor’s insolvency in order to maximize the value of its assets, to facilitate credit facility and to strike a balance between the interest of all the stakeholders. To achieve this goal, section 14 calls for a “moratorium” which is a period during no legal proceedings to recover money, enforce any security interest, sale or transfer of assets or termination of essential contracts that could be initiated or continued against a corporate debtor (“CD”). But the moratorium provision, as entailed in section 14(1)(a) of IBC has gone through vast judicial scrutiny and has been interpreted in a different manner to achieve the above-mentioned goal of IBC. Continuing with the judicial development of the IBC and interpretation of Section 14(1)(a) of the IBC, notices issued in the case of Malayan Banking Berhad v. Ushdev International Ltd. by the Supreme Court (“SC”) hold great importance, wherein one of the issues before the court  is whether suits filed “by the corporate debtor” are subject to moratorium under Section 14(1)(a) or not. Factual Background A review petition was filed before the Bombay HC by Malyan Banking Berhad titled Malayan Banking BHD v. Ushdev International Ltd.  to seek review of an order dated July 7, 2019 by Bombay HC in response to a Notice of Motion filed by Malyan Banking in a suit brought by Ushdev International Ltd. During the pendency of Notice of Motion proceedings, a case filed against Ushdev International Ltd. was admitted by the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”), Mumbai for initiating Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (“CIRP”) against the same. In view of the CIRP proceedings, Bombay HC vide order dated July 7, 2019 adjourned the proceeding of Notice of Motion sine die considering moratorium. In review petition, Bombay HC, through its order dated September 16, 2019 affirmed its order dated July 7, 2019 and held that the Notice of Motion would be considered a “proceeding” for purposes of section 14(1)(a) of the IBC as it seeks rejection of a suit initiated by CD who is undergoing CIRP and therefore barred by the moratorium. This order, dated September 16, 2019, by Bombay HC was challenged before the Supreme Court before a Special Leave Petition (“SLP”), to which SC ordered to issue notices for the same. Conundrum The notice issued by the SC points out that there exists a legal lacuna regarding the application of a moratorium upon proceedings initiated by the CD. The dilemma exists because of the fact that while section 14(1)(a) of IBC explicitly states that the proceedings “against the corporate debtor” are to be stayed. Yet, proceedings initiated “by the corporate debtor” are also stayed. Hence creating a murky legal situation so as to application of moratorium, thus leading to Malayan Banking Berhad filing an SLP before the SC. Judicial Trend A similar anomaly occurred in the case of Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. v. Jyoti Structures Ltd. before Delhi HC, wherein the Court, while interpreting section 14(1)(a) of the IBC, outlined the criteria required to assess the application of moratorium to proceedings initiated by the CD which are: “The nature of the proceedings has to be considered, and it has to be observed whether such proceedings are in the favor of the Corporate Debtor or against the Corporate Debtor.” Delhi HC ruled that if the above factors were in favour of the CD, then the application of moratorium to the proceedings initiated by the same would be harmful to the CD and would worsen the financials of the already financially stressed entity and thus would go against the mandate of the IBC. Court reasoned moratorium would not cover the proceedings initiated by the CD if the same is beneficial to the CD. Thus, proceedings that do not endanger, diminish, dissipate, or adversely impact the corporate debtor’s assets shall be continued if initiated by the CD. Delhi HC while interpreting the same, observed that the legislative intent behind section 14(1)(a) was to limit the application of moratorium to only those proceedings filed against the CD and not to those initiated by the same. This is evident from distinction between the phrase “by or against the corporate debtor” in section 33(5) and “against the corporate debtor” in section 14(1)(a) of the IBC where in the former has wider interpretation and the latter has rather more restrictive interpretation. In SSMP Industries Ltd. v. Perkan Food Processors Pvt. Ltd., the Delhi High Court recently uphold the above interpretation. The court was asked to determine whether adjudication of a suit brought by the CD and counterclaim brought in the same could be continued during the moratorium period. Following the rationale of Power Grid Corporation of India, Delhi HC did not order any stay on the proceedings and concluded that CD’s assets were not under any threat until the adjudication of the counter-claim and that moratorium would only be ordered once the counter-claim is adjudged and court orders for an amount to be paid or recovery or when execution proceedings are initiated against the CD. The Court further stated that the intent and purpose of the moratorium’s imposition must be satisfied and that a restricted approach cannot be used when determining whether it applies to proceedings brought by the CD. Similar approach has been followed in Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd v. IVRCL Ltd. wherein National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi (“NCLAT”) was tasked to decide on whether a claim initiated by the CD and a counter-claim brought in the same arbitration could be pursued during the moratorium. NCLAT held that the arbitration tribunal can hear both the CD’s claim and counter-claim simultaneously as the IBC does not bar the same, and if CD loses the case and court orders some recovery against the same, then the same recovery cannot be executed in the moratorium period. The above interpretation is backed by Allahabad HC in Trading Engineers International Ltd. v. U.P. Power Transmission Corpn. Ltd. There appears to be two views with regard to the application of moratorium on the proceedings initiated by the CD, wherein one view is that moratorium would include all proceedings whether initiated “by” or “against” the CD while the other view (the one taken in Power Grid Corporation of India) is that moratorium includes only proceedings filed against the CD and if it is the CD who initiates the proceedings, then application of the moratorium would only be considered after taking into account the benefit to the CD. Analysis of the Above Interpretation The Delhi HC in Power Grid Corporation of India and NCLAT in Jharkhand Bijli Vitran advocated a broad interpretation with regards to applicability of moratorium, in lines with the intent of the legislature which was to limit the applicability and meaning of moratorium under section 14(1)(a) of the IBC, which in a way works in the benefit of the CD but there appears to be some pitfalls of this interpretation as enlisted: Delay – While the enactment of the IBC was to expedite the CIRP or liquidity of the CD, if proceedings are allowed to be continued, this can result in exceeding the deadlines entailed in the regulation of the CIRP and the overall proceedings. Financial Stress – While the object of the CIRP is to make the CD come out of its stressed finances and resume operations back to track, but with continued proceedings, additional litigation expenses would further deteriorate the financials of the CD. Overburdening the judiciary – If courts are asked to determine whether a proceeding is in favour of the CD or not it would be equivalent to adjudication based on a sketchy understanding of the proceedings which could be prejudicial to the parties concerned and would lead to overrunning of judicial powers and functions. Recommendations and Conclusions While the interpretation adopted by Delhi HC and the criteria identified are laudatory yet there exist factors, including the status and the point of the proceedings, which also are needed to be taken into account, and a strict deadline shall be put forth for the adjudication of any pending proceedings filed by the CD so as to put into practise this interpretation. This interpretation is undoubtedly in consonance with the goals of the IBC and works in the benefit of the CD but requires strict judicial standards to identify which proceedings need to be stayed and which should not. It is essential to adopt a well-balanced approach while adhering to strict rules when determining whether the proceedings initiated by the CD could be taken for the adjudication amidst the moratorium as the same would benefit the CD, its creditors and associated parties. It would be interesting to observe how SC decides this issue, but the current interpretation seems to be the best way forward. – Kanishka Aswal & Ritik Jhanwar Insolvency Interpretation of statutes"

            "NCLAT’s Pronouncement in the DLF Case: An Unwarranted Restriction on the Commission’s Powers By GuestJanuary 27, 20237 Min readAdd comment   [Shourya Mitra is a penultimate year law student at Jindal Global Law School, Sonipat] Recently, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in the case of Amit Mittal v. DLF Ltd Competition Appeal (AT) No.82 of 2018 (DLF case),  passed an order remitting a case against DLF, back to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on account of the Commission’s order being void. The reason was that CCI had allegedly exceeded its jurisdiction while directing the Director General (DG) to investigate further. The Tribunal held that the Commission could only direct a further investigation by the DG if the DG concluded that there was no breach of the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002. In effect, the Commission cannot disagree with the affirmative findings of the DG and order further investigation.  In remitting the matter back to the Commission, the Tribunal ended up limiting the scope of the Commission’s power to give findings independently of the report of the DG which will be discussed further. The Timeline Summarised The Informant had alleged that DLF was abusing its dominant position via its agreements with homebuyers which had arbitrary and one-sided clauses. The Commission had found prima facie contravention and had ordered the DG to investigate. The DG had also concluded in the affirmative. However, the commission directed the DG to conduct a further investigation pursuant to its powers under regulation 20(6) of the Competition Commission of India (General) Regulations, 2009. The DG in its supplementary report found that there was no contravention of the provisions and based on this supplementary report, the Commission concluded that further proceedings were not necessary and decided to close the case. On appeal, the NCLAT examined the provisions contained in section 26 of the Competition Act, 2002 and concluded that CCI has limited jurisdiction to direct further investigation. Accordingly, the only case in which the Commission can direct further investigation is under sections 26(5) read with 26(7) wherein the DG has concluded that no contravention of the provisions exists. Section 26(5) envisages a situation wherein the DG recommends that there is no contravention, and the Commission invites objections from the concerned parties. Under section 26(7), the Commission can order a further investigation by the DG after taking into account any objections that may have been raised under section 26(5). It also dismissed the argument that regulation 20(6) allows for the Commission to direct further investigation even in cases where the DG recommends the existence of a contravention. The NCLAT held that the reading of regulation 20(6) must be restricted within the framework of section 26 which only explicitly permits such direction under 26(7). The implication of this ratio however goes beyond just restricting the power of the Commission to order further investigation. It indirectly restricts the Commission from disagreeing with the affirmative findings of the DG as the Commission cannot use its investigating arm to deal with any irregularities that may exist in the report and direct further investigation. Further, this may be quite problematic on three fronts:  This undermines the idea that the Commission is to assess the report of DG independently and is free to disagree with it; It ignores the potential irregularities that tend to show up in the investigation of the DG and the far-reaching consequences of it; The ruling fails to acknowledge both the pre-existing jurisprudence as well as the prospective changes in the law that are to come.  The Commission’s Ability to Give Findings Independent of the Report The High Court of Delhi in the case of Saurabh Tripathy v. CCI held that a report by the DG under section 26(8) which recommends that there are contraventions, is not binding on the Commission and that the provisions of section 26(7) and (8) are merely enabling provisions that allow the Commission to proceed with further inquiry/investigation. Similar rulings have also been given by the Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT), and the NCLAT wherein it was held that the Commission can order a further investigation by the DG if it is not satisfied with the report of the DG and that the Commission has to apply its mind independently of the Report. The report of the DG is merely recommendatory in nature. The order of the NCLAT in the DLF case overlooks this independence that is attributed to the Commission.  The Far-reaching Implications of an Erroneous DG Investigation The DG has wide powers, and the consequences of the investigation can be very far-reaching. There have been numerous cases wherein the DG has given findings that are speculative or erroneous. For instance, in the case of Google Matrimony, one of the findings with respect to the abuse of dominance was termed as egregious, and in the realm of speculation, as the DG had recommended a contravention on the fact that there was some “scope” for Google to interpret the clauses in a certain manner. Additionally, the COMPAT in Gurpreet Singh, held that the DG was pre-determined to reach a finding that showed the contravention of the provisions. This led the DG to resort to certain distasteful means in its investigation which were “totally unjustified and contrary to the basics of fairness and natural justice”. Even mere errors of the DG have had immense consequences, such as in the recent ruling of the NCLAT in the Tyre Cartel case, wherein the DG’s analysis of price parallelism in its report had miscalculations which if corrected, would show a result to the contrary of such allegation. Consequently, the NCLAT had to remand the matter back to the CCI for reconsideration. The ratio of the NCLAT in the DLF case results in imposing such reports on the Commission, despite the fact that they often may consist of such errors. The Disregard of the Pre-existing Jurisprudence and Prospective Changes to Law The Apex Court in the case of CCI v. SAIL stated that: “If there is contravention of any of the provisions of the Act and in the opinion of the Commission, further inquiry is needed, then it shall conduct such further inquiry into the matter itself or direct the Director General to do so in accordance with the provisions of the Act”. This statement is reflective of the fact that the Commission is free to choose how it wants to proceed further. Similarly, a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court has held that if the DG’s report recommends contravention, then the CCI is “obliged to proceed and investigate further”. The NCLAT failed to take these rulings into account. Further, it should also have considered the Competition Law review Committee Report, 2019, wherein the Committee identified a problem that on a bare reading of section 26(8), there is an impression created, that CCI cannot disagree with the recommendations of the DG, which is not the case. Similarly on a bare reading of section 26(7), an impression is created that CCI cannot pass the appropriate final orders which was also sought to be corrected by the committee. Further, the recent Competition Amendment Bill, 2022 also highlights the intent of the legislature wherein the proposed section 26(3A) provides the Commission with the power to direct the DG to further investigate irrespective of whether the DG recommends a contravention or not. Conclusion The Tribunal’s ruling and remission fail to consider the pre-existing jurisprudence and also overlook the prospective changes in the law that are to come. The order of the NCLAT for all the above-mentioned reasons may act as a hindrance to the independence of the Commission and restrict it from using its own investigating arm for further investigation. The NCLAT’s reasoning that regulation 20(6) should be restricted within the framework of section 26 should have been considered carefully as the proposed amendment does envisage a situation where the Commission can direct further investigation, irrespective of the nature of the DG’s findings. The same, however, will hopefully be statutorily remedied as and when the bill is passed in the upcoming budget session. – Shourya Mitra Competition Law"

            "Supreme Court Reiterates Rectificatory Jurisdiction Under Companies Act: A Conundrum Involving NCLT and SEBI By GuestJanuary 26, 20237 Min readAdd comment   [Anshita Dave and Abhyudaya Yadav are 5th year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) students at Dharmashastra National Law University, Jabalpur] Recently, the Supreme Court in IFB Agro Industries Limited v. SICGIL India Limited held that the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) cannot exercise its rectificatory jurisdiction under section 59 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) to correct disputed errors which fall under the adjudicatory realm of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”). Prima facie, there exists a jurisdictional overlap between the NCLT and SEBI. However, relying on its earlier precedents, the Court clearly demonstrated the scope of NCLT’s jurisdiction under section 59 of the Act. This post delves into the reasoning adopted by the Supreme Court while analyzing the scope of preliminary inquiry and extent of adjudicatory powers of NCLT in a  petition under section 59 of the Act. Further, it analyzes the role of SEBI and sectoral regulators in this regard and attempts to streamline the procedure where SEBI and sectoral regulators play pivotal roles. Factual Matrix IFB Agro Industries Ltd. (“IFB Agro”) and SICGIL India Ltd. (“SICGIL”) are listed entities engaged in the business of liquid chemicals. IFB Agro alleged that the Managing Director (“MD”) of SICGILL had approached IFB Agro to enter into a business tie-up in August 2003, but IFB Agro rejected the offer. Thereafter, the MD of SICGILL, along with his wife and SICGILL started buying shares of IFB Agro from the open market. As a result, the collective shareholding of SICGILL, MD of SICGILL, his wife, and other connected persons (collectively referred to as “SICGILL”) exceeded 5%, thereby triggering regulation 7(1) of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 1997 (“SAST Regulations”). Pursuant to its obligations under the SAST Regulations, SICGILL made the required disclosure; however, the same was alleged not to be in the prescribed format. Four months later, SICGILL acquired additional shares of IFB Agro and consequently increased the individual shareholding of MD of SICGILL beyond 5%. As a result, disclosure obligations under SAST Regulations and SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (“PIT Regulations”) were triggered again. The MD of SICGILL admitted that he inadvertently failed to make the required disclosures. Furthermore, IFB Agro submitted that it came to know about the shareholding when it conducted an internal inquiry into the same. Thus, a petition was filed before the Company Law Board (“CLB”) to rectify the register for deleting the name of SICGILL as shareholders under section 111A of the Companies Act, 1956. As a result of the petition, SICGILL reduced its shareholding in IFB Agro below 5%, which was again contested by IFB Agro as SICGILL had never really reduced its shareholding. During the pendency of the petition, the 2013 Act came into being, and the matter was transferred to the NCLT for adjudication. The NCLT held that there had been a violation of the SEBI regulations, and allowed IFB Agro to delete the name of SICGILL from its register to undo the mischief. It further ordered IFB Agro to buy back the shares held by SICGILL. The matter went on appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (“NCLAT”), which then overturned the NCLT’s decision without giving adequate reasoning. Thus, the present appeal was preferred by IFB Agro in the Supreme Court. Issue and Ruling This part analyses the scope of section 111A of the Companies Act, 1956, which was replaced by section 59 of the 2013 Act. Ambit of Section 59 of the Companies Act, 2013 One of the principal contentions raised by the counsel for IFB Agro was that the scope of section 56 of the 2013 Act is wider than section 111A and section 155 of the 1956 Act. However, while rejecting the argument, the Court held that the rectificatory power of the tribunal is summary in nature. The rectification of the register must be founded on evident facts. The essential ingredients of such powers have been the same in each successive provision. The Supreme Court relied on Ammonia Supplies Corporation v. Modern Plastic Containers. In this case, the Court had ruled that when the claim is based on some seriously disputed rights or title or any fact which may form the foundation of such claim, the Court shall refer such applicant to the appropriate forum if it believes that such claims do not constitute rectification but instead adjudication of some other disputed fact which is not under the rectificatory powers of the courts. Subsequent rulings such as Standard Chartered Bank v. Andhra Bank Financial Services Ltd. and Jai Mahal Hotels (P) Ltd. v. Devraj Singh reaffirmed the ratio of the abovementioned case. The Court, in subsequent cases, observed that despite the enlarged scope of section 111A as compared to section 155 of the 1956 Act, the rectificatory powers of the courts remained summary in nature. Therefore, in cases of seriously disputed facts, the courts should relegate the matter to the most appropriate forum for investigating and adjudicating such facts. The present case involved the interference of NCLT in the investigation and adjudication of matters involving a violation of SEBI regulations. The Court, in this regard, referred to Kesha Appliances (P) Ltd v. Royal Holding Services, wherein the Bombay High Court observed that the matters arising of violation of SEBI Regulation fall within the exclusive domain of SEBI and recourse to any court of law is barred by express prohibition contained under section 15Y and 20A of the SEBI Act, 1992. Despite the fact that it is the common law right of shareholders to apply for rectification of the register, if the same flows from the breach of takeover regulation, then undoubtedly, the matter falls within the exclusive domain of SEBI. Therefore, in the present case, the Court noted the limited scope of rectificatory jurisdiction of the Court and jurisdiction of SEBI regarding the adjudication of matters relating to violation of SAST Regulations and PIT Regulations. Accordingly, it held that the NCLAT was right in setting aside the appeal and further opined that the tribunal should have directed IFB Agro to approach SEBI for adjudication of existing disputed facts. Analysis & Way Forward The Court did not delve into the question of the scope of preliminary inquiry and residual adjudicatory realm while deciding the matter under section 59 of the Act. In deciding rectification petitions, the NCLT is at least expected to decide the validity of the transfer of shares. It cannot pass a rectification order when the transfer of shares itself is void. Similarly, when a plea of mala fide, capricious and corrupt actions of management of the company is raised due to which entries in the register are not as per the law and legitimate claims of other shareholders, the burden of proof lies on the petitioner who has to discharge the burden by producing the relevant evidence. Hence, when evidence is placed before NCLT, it needs to apply its judicial mind to determine the issues involved. Although rectificatory powers under section 59 of the Act empower the NCLT to determine the title of any person on shares, it is applicable only in non-controversial matters. It does not extend to the settlement of disputes requiring a detailed and meticulous examination of complicated questions of law and fact. Moreover, it cannot act as an investigating authority. Despite proceedings under section 59 of the Act being summary proceedings and rectificatory powers provided being limited, there exists some residual adjudicatory powers in the hands of the NCLT. In this residual adjudicatory realm, the NCLT applies its judicial mind to adjudicate rectification petitions. Therefore, in this regard, the observation of the court in the present case that the rectification must relate to and be confined to the facts that are ‘evident and require no serious enquiry’ is ambiguous. To the extent the requirement of ’no serious enquiry’ persists, there seems to be no ambiguity, but on reading it with the term ‘evident’, it significantly reduces the scope of adjudicatory powers of NCLT under section 59 of the Act. – Anshita Dave and Abhyudaya Yadav Companies Act Company Law SEBI Securities Regulation Takeover Regulations"

        "read_on_content": [
            "The Bombay High Court’s Yes Bank Judgement: Falling Short on Fairness By GuestJanuary 24, 202310 Min readAdd comment   [Harsh Vardhan is a management consultant and Bhargavi Zaveri Shah a doctoral researcher at the Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore and an editor of IndiaCorpLaw Blog] Last week, the Bombay High Court set aside the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-appointed administrator’s decision to write off the additional tier (AT1) bonds issued by Yes Bank in 2016 and 2017. In 2020, when a financially beleaguered Yes Bank was restructured, the administrator wrote off several AT1 bonds, disentitling the bond holders from being repaid their investment. In 2021, several bond holders challenged the write off before the Bombay High Court on the grounds of it being arbitrary and unreasonable. In evaluating the merits of the challenge, the Court restricted itself to one question, namely, “[w]hether the Administrator would be competent to write off the AT-1 bonds on March 14, 2020 i.e. the day after the final Yes Bank Reconstruction Scheme 2020 was notified on March 13, 2020.” The Court set aside the write off decision on the ground that Yes Bank’s administrator had exceeded his powers by making a ‘policy decision’ not envisaged under the restructuring scheme, and implementing it a day after the scheme was operationalised. The Court explicitly refrained from questioning the fairness of the write off and restricted itself to the procedural lapses involved in the implementation of the write-off.  In this post, we argue that the Court erred by not questioning the fairness of the administrator’s decision to selectively write off the AT1 bonds. By overlooking the question of fairness, the Court chose to ignore the crux of the issue at hand, namely, whether the administrator’s decision to write off Yes Bank’s AT1 bonds was arbitrary and violated the doctrine of legitimate expectations. We argue that a reasoned determination of this question is critical to the case at hand and for Indian banking generally.  Judicial restraint on questioning fairness  A key concern arising from Yes Bank’s restructuring exercise was the decision to write off the listed, perpetual and unsecured AT1 bonds issued by Yes Bank in 2016 and 2017, without writing down its equity shares. Before the Court, the bond holders argued that this decision was arbitrary, unfair and violated the doctrine of legitimate expectations. The doctrine of legitimate expectations envisages that an administrative authority (in this case, the RBI-appointed administrator) will treat a person in line with expectations that have arisen from an established custom or practice, even in the absence of any legal right to be treated as such. The Court explicitly refused to deal with this argument, in the following words: “The matter being fiscal in nature, this Court would not dwell into the aspect as to whether the writing off the AT-1 bonds was necessary. We would not enter into a debate as to whether the AT-1 bonds could have been converted into the shares and or whether they could have been proportionately written down. The Court would not possess the necessary expertise of the same.” (para 77) This rationale offered by the Court for its self-imposed restraint is weak. A determination on whether a statutory administrator could have unilaterally opted to upend the inter se rights and expectations of equity and bond holders is not a matter of a ‘fiscal nature’. Fiscal matters are commonly understood as referring to matters involving government spending.  In Yes Bank’s case, the statutory administrator actively accorded preferential treatment to equity shareholders over bond holders.  The question of whether such a preferential treatment violated the legitimate expectations of bond holders is within the remit of judicial adjudication, just like any other question of fairness. For instance, the judgement records that the administrator wrote off only two of the three tranches of AT1 bonds issued by Yes Bank without furnishing reasons. Such a selective write off would warrant questioning the basis for preferentially treating the bondholders who were not written off to the prejudice of those who were. It would similarly warrant questioning the reason for prioritising the rights of equity shareholders over the holders of the written off bonds.  The judgement records other facts which would warrant further questioning. For instance, the Court found that the RBI had originally proposed the conversion of the AT1 bonds to equity shares of Yes Bank at a pre-defined ratio “to balance the interests of all the stakeholders” (paras 18, 35). Further, while the proposal to convert the AT1 bonds was present in the draft scheme published for feedback and consultation by the RBI, it was deleted from the final scheme that was ultimately notified. These findings ought to have motivated questions on the sudden decision to write down select tranches of AT1 bonds. From the judgement, it appears that none of these questions were asked due to the self-imposed judicial restraint. Prioritising equity over debt violates legitimate expectations The Court’s restraint on questioning the fairness of the write down implicitly validates the administrator’s decision to prioritise equity shareholders over bond holders. It turns the common understanding of debt and equity contracts on its head without providing any reason for doing so.        Under Indian banking law, perpetual bonds issued by banks (often called “Perps” by the debt market participants) are counted as “additional tier I capital” or Additional Tier I (AT1) bonds. These bonds form an important source of capital for banks, especially the public sector banks. These bonds are de jure perpetual, that is, they have no maturity. They carry coupon interest like any other bonds.  An important feature of these bonds in India is that they have all been issued so far with a call option. Thus, while the bonds do not have a defined maturity, this option gives the issuer (the banks) a right but not an obligation to ‘call’ these bonds at a pre-defined maturity. For most of the bonds, this call option date is five years from the issuance date. This implies that the issuing bank may call these bonds after five years from the issue date. In fact, all the issuers of AT1 bonds have, so far, have exercised the call option and redeemed these bonds.  For market participants, the call option exercise date had become the de facto maturity date reflecting a tacit understanding that the issuer would redeem these bonds on this date. In other words, there was a legitimate expectation that the bonds will be redeemed by the issuer bank on the call option date. Thus, while these bonds are de jureperpetual, de facto they have a maturity determined by the exercise date of the call option on them. Institutional investors (such as mutual funds), for all practical purposes, treated the call option exercise date as the maturity date of these bonds.            As a part of the ‘rescue plan’ for Yes Bank, the administrator wrote off the AT1 bonds.  While such a writing off is permitted as per the covenants of these bonds, the fact that these bonds were written off before writing down common equity capital was against the market expectations and conventions.  For instance, the Basel III norms of capital that guide banking regulators across the world and the RBI’s Master Circular of 2012 which reflect these norms, clearly stipulate that the Tier I bonds are ‘junior to all other debt but senior to the common equity capital of the bank’.  With this norm and the market practice of redeeming these bonds on their call option date, investors in these bonds expected to not bear any losses before common equity was completely wiped off.  Impact on cost of risk capital for banks Finally, the Court’s abstention from adjudicating the question of fairness has implications for the limited risk capital available for Indian banks. This is evident from the events that immediately transpired after the write off.  Following the Yes Bank episode, there was anxiety in the bond investor community regarding the status of AT1 bonds.  It was generally believed that the regulatory approach in the case of Yes Bank could be also used in other banks facing solvency problems. After this episode, for some time the AT1 bond issuances almost stopped and the secondary market prices of these bonds declined resulting in a decline in the net asset values of mutual funds that had invested in these bonds.   Consequently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), as the regulator of mutual funds, was compelled to step in. The main rule change that SEBI brought in was about the way these bonds were valued by the investors including mutual funds.  In the past, most investors would treat the call option date on these bonds as the effective maturity date for the bonds and value them accordingly. SEBI, however, mandated that the bonds must be valued assuming a maturity period of 100 years.  Valuing these bonds at such a long maturity would dramatically reduce their value, impacting the funds that invested in them.   While SEBI later deferred the implementation of these new valuation norms, it became clear that the de facto maturity that funds used to value these bonds will eventually not be permitted.   Conclusion In the past, Indian courts have refused to adjudicate upon matters involving economic policy or the fairness of contracts, even if inconsistently so. The question of the fairness of writing off debt before equity in Yes Bank’s restructuring exercise is not an economic policy because it is a decision applied to one particular case and not at a policy level. It is not about the fairness of the contract between Yes Bank and the written off bond holders because the decision was unilaterally taken by a statutory administrator, and not by any of the parties to the contract.   The Court’s refusal to question the fairness of the write off has significant implications for future bank restructuring exercises. First, it lays down the precedent that the courts will not intervene in questions of fairness in bank restructuring, thereby considerably expanding the scope of discretion of the RBI and the Central Government in bank restructuring exercises. While discretion in restructuring may be favoured for the sake of efficiency and capital preservation, a decision to override legitimate expectations by preferring one group of right holders over another must be supported with reasons. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the Court’s refusal to adjudicate on the fairness of the write off validates the notion that in a future bank restructuring, AT1 bonds could be forced to absorb losses before common equity.  This will significantly increase the perceived risk in these bonds and investors will price this risk.  The yields to be offered to investors for absorbing this an equity-like risk will have to rise resulting in an increase in the overall cost of capital for banks. Going ahead, we may well see AT1 bonds become as expensive a layer of capital as equity for Indian banks. – Harsh Vardhan & Bhargavi Zaveri Shah Banking Corporate Bonds Debt Restructuring RBI"

            "Mutual Funds, Insider Trading and the Myth of Sisyphus By GuestJanuary 24, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Shruti Rajan is a partner at Trilegal] In Greek mythology, the gods condemned Sisyphus to an endless cycle of rolling a boulder up a hill, have it roll down and then start again. A parable of the interminable, eternal human struggle against the diktat of the gods, the fate of Sisyphus has long served as a metaphor for the repetitive and dogged demands of modern life and business. Introducing a new legal regime and a host of Sisyphean compliances for both asset management companies (“AMCs”) as well as their “fiduciaries”, the Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) approved a proposal to amend the Insider Trading Regulations, 2015 (“PIT Regulations”) at a board meeting dated September 30, 2022, which was soon followed by a gazette notification dated November 24, 2022.  What Do These Amendments Do? The amendments have been brought in to enable SEBI to utilise the insider trading blueprint for monitoring transactions in mutual funds as well as deploy the standards available under that regime for investigation and enforcement. Simply put, the amendments create an absolute equivalence between a listed security and mutual fund units, irrespective of whether the mutual fund units are listed or whether the AMC managing such funds is a listed company.  It does so by extending both legal as well as compliance concepts under the PIT framework into the mutual fund universe, in the following manner: Key legal changes (i)        It amends the definition of “securities” in the PIT Regulations to include units issued by a mutual fund and also introduces terms such as “redeem” and switch” into the definition of trading; (ii)       It amends the definition of “connected person” and expands on the list of “deemed to be connected persons” to include the following:  Persons associated with mutual funds/AMCs or their trustees by virtue of a contractual, fiduciary, professional business or employment relationship as well as due to being in frequent communication with its officers, in a manner that would allow or be reasonably expected to allow, for direct or indirect access to UPSI; Immediate relatives of such persons; Sponsor of the mutual fund as the holding, subsidiary  or associate company of the sponsor/AMC /trustees; Board of directors and key managerial personnel of the sponsor; Directors and employees of intermediaries that interact with mutual funds, such as registrar and transfer agents, custodians, banks, valuation agencies, lawyers, auditors, fund accountants, etc, where they have or can be reasonably expected to have access to the UPSI of a scheme or its units, in the course of business operations; Officials of self-regulatory organizations and stock exchanges;  Any entity (incorporated or otherwise) where a director of an AMC, trustee or his immediate relative or a banker of the company, has more than 10% interest.  (iii)      The term “unpublished price sensitive information” in the context of mutual fund units has been defined to include instances where there is a likelihood of the following, which would correspondingly materially affect the net asset value of mutual fund units (“NAV”) upon being generally available:  a change in the accounting policy; a material change in the valuation of any asset or class of assets; restrictions on redemptions, winding up of scheme(s); creation of segregated portfolios; the triggering of the swing pricing framework and the applicability of the swing factor; material change in the liquidity position of the concerned mutual fund scheme(s); default in the underlying securities which is material to the concerned mutual fund scheme(s).  (iv)      An explanation to the definition of ‘generally available information’ has been added, reiterating that AMCs and trustees must immediately disseminate all material information to unitholders. However, the term “likelihood” itself has not been defined.  Key compliance requirements In addition to the changes in law, the amendments also introduce a host of new compliance requirements by importing the entire pre-clearance regime applicable to equities and other listed securities to AMCs and their “fiduciaries” and transplanting it for mutual fund units.  (i)        Akin to the restricted list/grey list process being followed for listed securities, AMCs and their fiduciaries will now have to pre-clear all mutual fund transactions of designated employees and block those which are in schemes of fund houses that the organization or its personnel may/are likely to have unpublished price sensitive information (“UPSI”) on.  (ii)       The amendments also require AMCs to frame a legitimate purpose policy for sharing information as well as formulate policies on investigation of UPSI leaks and whistleblower complaints (similar to what listed companies do now).  (iii)      Both AMCs and fiduciaries who do business with them are also required to maintain a structured digital database, which is a master roster that tracks the what, who, when of each instance of UPSI shared within and outside of an organization. As is the case for listed companies currently, this database cannot be outsourced and has to be retained for eight years or until completion of SEBI’s investigation/enforcement, whichever is later. It is pertinent to note here that the law does not provide a statutory period within which investigations or enforcement proceedings must be completed, neither is there a process to confirm closure of an investigation.  Impact Assessment  The applicability of insider trading laws to mutual funds has been a matter of much debate and well covered in an interesting post on this Blog last year. The concept of insider trading, when looked at from the vantage point of market efficiency, has little relevance to unlisted mutual fund units where investors do not operate within a single market to exchange these goods at discovered prices; rather in mutual fund transactions, the counterparty is the AMC itself. However, when understood as a tool to neutralise the information asymmetry advantage, insider trading laws are an elegant theoretical device in the world of mutual funds.  For some time now, SEBI has been keen on introducing a sterner regime around mutual fund transactions and had issued a consultation paper outlining this objective, back in July 2022. The mutual fund industry itself is no stranger to regulations around its key employees’ transactions in units of the entity’s own schemes as well as in other listed securities, across both the primary and secondary markets, For decades, SEBI has had fetters around trades by “access persons” to prevent conflict of interest and many fund houses even opt to put in pre-clearance stipulations for all trades in their schemes. Specifically, SEBI’s rules also mandated employees of an AMC, its board members/trustees to not place orders for units in any mutual fund scheme if in possession of non-public, NAV altering information; a list of examples set out in those circulars is in fact, identical to the modified definition of UPSI, now introduced in the amendments.  Therefore, the heart of the amendment’s impact lies not in changing the law or introducing a new regime for AMCs – these are already in existence today – but in transforming the receptacle that contains it. The amendments now arm SEBI with an almost match-point advantage of reversing the onus of proof on the insider/connected persons of fund houses, by requiring them to rebut the presumption of guilt, a benefit not available to it thus far, when taking action under the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 or the mutual fund framework. By shifting the regulatory basis of trial and the evidentiary burden, SEBI has reconstructed its enforcement pitch for violations going forward, such that in cases where access persons of mutual funds undertake transactions in their schemes, the onus will be on the persons/entities under question, to demonstrate that they were not in possession of UPSI while doing so.  Hence, while the appeal of such an amendment from a legal standpoint is obvious, the need for the corresponding, accompanying army of compliance requirements is not quite as easy to comprehend. This is especially true for fiduciaries or intermediaries that work with mutual funds. A number of such entities such as brokers, custodians, banks are primarily execution-only service providers, who are empanelled for specific purposes and rarely serve as advisers or consultants who are likely to be privy to sensitive information regarding the schemes they deal with. But by not providing a specific carve-out for such businesses, and failing to distinguish them from other services that may actually have a finger of the fund house’s pulse, SEBI has left it to institutions themselves to create their roadmap for satisfactory compliance. To comply with SEBI’s mandate under the amendments, fiduciaries will now have to pre-clear all mutual fund purchases, switches and redemptions by designated persons within their organization, to ensure that transactions in fund houses they work with, are sifted out. Depending on the nature of their businesses and the size of the organization, the time, scale and costs involved in operationalising such an exercise, will be significant.  Maintaining a digital database will also be a steep learning curve for these entities, given the subjectivity that surrounds terms such as “likelihood” of a “material impact” on the NAV and in practice, intermediaries will likely rely on the AMC to decide on the trigger point for identifying such information as UPSI on their databases. If not possible to accurately estimate, at least a ballpark empirical assessment (within the constraints of available information) of the cost benefit ratio involved in such an intensive industrywide compliance re-haul, would have been useful prior to introduction. Appraising the likely costs of compliance against the likely incremental advantage that such databases allow SEBI during investigations, should be treated as a necessary line item of regulatory design.  Another issue that merits consideration is the burden this places on an already beleaguered body of compliance officers of AMCs and other intermediaries, who will need to implement and man these complex databases, policies and pre-clearances. Unforced errors may be many, especially in the initial years of roll out and hence, senior manager and compliance officer liability should be read down considerately. The real impact of these amendments will be felt only when it is used for timely enforcement against those violating its spirit, rather than letting it spawn a quire of show-cause notices to organizations or their officers, for not conforming with the peripheral compliances, policies and databases. This will only trigger an avoidable, futile cycle of litigation and settlements, without addressing the primary delinquencies, for which it all came to pass. – Shruti Rajan Insider Trading SEBI Securities Regulation"

            "The Singapore Court of Appeal on Arbitrability and the Proper Law of Arbitration Agreements By V. NiranjanJanuary 23, 20236 Min readAdd comment   In its recent judgment Mittal v Westbridge Ventures, the Singapore Court of Appeal has considered a number of important questions of arbitration law concerning the proper law of arbitration agreements and the identification of the law which determines whether a particular dispute is arbitrable. The case is likely to be of particular interest to Indian practitioners because it illustrates why in practice the identification of the proper law of the arbitration agreement matters, especially where one of the candidates is Indian law. The case arose out of a dispute between the shareholders of a company called People Interactive (India) Pvt Ltd. This company owns and operates the well-known matrimonial website, shaadi.com. In 2006, Westbridge invested in the Company and entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement with the promoters (including Mr Mittal, the appellant in the Singapore Court of Appeal). Clause 20.2 of the SHA stated that ‘This Agreement and its performance shall be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of the Republic of India’ but also contained an ICC arbitration clause providing for arbitration in Singapore. In 2017, disputes arose following an indication by Westbridge that it wished to sell its shares to an entity which the promoters considered was a competitor of the Company. The promoters commenced proceedings in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking relief for what they said was oppression and mismanagement. In response, Westbridge commenced proceedings in Singapore seeking an anti-suit injunction restraining the promoters from continuing the NCLT proceedings on the ground that the dispute fell within the arbitration agreement in clause 20. At first instance, the Judge granted an anti-suit injunction, finding that it is the law of the seat (here Singapore law), notthe law governing the arbitration agreement, which determines whether a particular dispute is arbitrable. That finding meant that it was irrelevant that disputes relating to oppression and mismanagement are not arbitrable under Indian law, because whether this dispute was arbitrable was to be answered by reference to Singapore law as the law of the seat. The Singapore Court of Appeal came to the same conclusion but for very different reasons. In her judgment, Judith Prakash JA began by pointing out – as had the UK Supreme Court in Enka v Chubb – that it would be anomalous if the same question (e.g. arbitrability) were to be decided by reference to one law at the pre-award stage but a different law at the post-award stage. At the post-award stage, if an award is challenged on the ground that one or more of the claims were not arbitrable, that challenge falls to be decided in accordance with the law applicable to the arbitration agreement. Judith Prakash JA ultimately concluded that both the law of the seat and the law applicable to the arbitration agreement are relevant for this purpose because if a particular dispute is not arbitrable under either law, that reflects public policy under that law. The consequence of this analysis is that a claim cannot proceed to arbitration in Singapore if it is non-arbitrable either under Singapore law as the law of the seat or under the law applicable to the arbitration agreement. That meant that it was necessary to identify the law governing the arbitration agreement. As to that, Judith Prakash JA began by noting that the express choice of Indian law in clause 20.1 of the SHA did not constitute an express choice of law for the arbitration agreement contained in the SHA because an ‘express choice of law for an arbitration agreement would only be found where there is explicit language stating so in no uncertain terms’. Judith Prakash JA acknowledged that clause 20.1 was nonetheless capable of amounting to an implied choice of Indian law for the arbitration agreement, citing as authority for this proposition a number of Singapore and English cases, including Sulamerica v Enesa which Judith Prakash JA described as the leading case – perhaps a surprising description in view of the subsequent decision of the UK Supreme Court (largely endorsing the analysis in Sulamerica) in Enka v Chubb. There was, however, a sting in the tail. Although an express choice of law for the main contract is normally an implied choice of law for the arbitration agreement (as both Enka and Sulamerica decide), that is not an invariable rule; and the UK Supreme Court in Enka identified the so-called ‘validation principle’ as an exception to it, namely the principle that if the application of the law chosen by the parties for the main contract would either invalidate the arbitration agreement or render it ineffective, that may be an indication that the parties did not, despite the express choice of law clause, intend that law to apply to the arbitration agreement. That was the conclusion to which Judith Prakash JA came in this case because the application of Indian law to the arbitration agreement would ‘negate the agreement since oppression claims (which are often intertwined with management disputes) are not arbitrable in India’. That was sufficient to neutralise the implication that would otherwise arise out of clause 20.1; and in the absence of any choice of law, the arbitration agreement was found to be governed by Singapore law as the law of the seat. The anti-suit injunction granted by the Court below was therefore upheld albeit on different grounds. This case is significant for three reasons. First, it highlights the fact that a dispute may not in practice be arbitrable unless it is arbitrable under both the law of the seat and the law applicable to the arbitration agreement (and therefore the importance of choosing with care both a seat and the proper law of the arbitration agreement). Second, it confirms that the Singapore Court of Appeal – by contrast to the UK Supreme Court – generally does not treat an express choice of law clause in a contract as an express choice of law for the arbitration agreement contained in that contract (it can, at most, amount an implied choice of law). Third – and perhaps most significantly – it vividly demonstrates why the ‘validation exception’ identified by the UK Supreme Court in Enka is likely in practice to apply more frequently than is apparent from the judgment itself. Although the UK Supreme Court gave a number of reasons in Enka for treating a choice of law for the main contract as a choice of law for the arbitration agreement, this would matter in practice only if the two systems of law treat arbitrability or some other aspect of arbitration agreements differently; but it is precisely in those circumstances that the ‘validation exception’ is likely also to apply, more often than is apparent, and with the result that the general rule is narrower in its practical application than one might envisage. It tends also to reinforce Lord Hoffmann’s powerful criticisms of the reasoning of the majority in Enka. Arbitration Company Law International Developments"

            "Designing a Framework for Disclosures of “Market Rumors” under the LODR Regulations By GuestJanuary 16, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Harsh N Dudhe is a IV year student at NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad] Much has already been said (here and here) about the pitfalls of the mandate proposed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on top 250 listed companies to confirm or deny market rumors, as part of the continuous disclosure mechanism. The major criticism is that such disclosures would premature and may adversely affect deal price and deal certainty, and will likely militate against the interests of investors. However, in my view, there is still a practical need for the said disclosure, as several investors would still rely on them to make their investment decisions in companies. In that light, I argue that SEBI would need to alter its proposed framework and take into account certain nuances to make the proposal more workable. Background & Analysis Before delving into the suggested model, it would be imperative to understand the background of the proposal and its flaws. On March 4, 2020, Jio Platforms Limited (a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL)) entered into a non-binding term sheet with Facebook in relation to the latter’s proposed investment in Jio Platforms Limited. At the stage of the negotiations and due diligence of the deal, the Financial Times on March 24, 2020, published an article titled “Facebook eyes multi-billion dollar stake in Reliance Jio”. The price of RIL’s scrip rose by 14.72% on March 25, 2020, which indicated that this particular deal was price sensitive. In its order dated June 20, 2022, SEBI held that once RIL came to know about the rumor, it was duty bound to make the said disclosure under regulation 30(11) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), 2015, as this information was price sensitive in nature. A similar situation arose during the Zomato’s acquisition of Blinkit, in which news reports in circulation hinted that such an acquisition was about to take place. In relation to this, several investors wrote to SEBI complaining that such a rumor should have been clarified by Zomato. The sentiments of these investors seem to have been reflected in the discussion paper released by SEBI on November 12, 2022, which lays down the following framework: “Provided that top 250 listed entities shall necessarily confirm or deny any event or information reported in the mainstream media, whether in print  or  digital  mode, which  may  have  material  effect  on  the  listed entity under this regulation. Explanation –The top 250 listed entities shall be determined on the basis of market capitalization, as at the end of the immediate previous financial year” The intent of SEBI is rather clear – that since investors rely on such information, it is preferable to mandate the denial or confirmation of rumors from the companies itself. However, such a framework is arguably insufficient, as it leaves many gaps which may be misused in a matter would operate against SEBI’s objective of promoting the securities market, and protecting the rights of the investors. Firstly, the discussion paper is silent on when precisely such a disclosure needs to be made. This leaves a significant degree of discretion to the companies as to the timing of the disclosure. It may also lead to a situation where the disclosures come at a time that may turn out to be too late for the investors to make an informed decision. Secondly, such disclosures would certainly affect deal price as well as deal certainty. As witnessed in the Jio-Facebook deal, the share price of Reliance Industries Limited saw traction in just one day after the Financial Times article in relation to this deal was published. However, any confirmation or denial of the same can severely affect the deal price and can affect negotiations. In cases where the prices move upwards, the seller can demand a higher price making the deal too expensive for the buyer to invest. The opposite situation may make the deal unfeasible for the seller. In either case, such a proposal would severely affect the price, and result in the feasibility of the deal itself. On the other hand, even if such disclosures are made, they would always be premature before they actually fructify. This is because deals may fall through at any moment. For better or worse, if the transaction surrounding the rumor does not materialise, it may also lead to a charge from the investors as to the creation of a false market, which may again place an unnecessary burden on the company.  Thirdly, there is no guidance on what constitutes “mainstream media”.  In the present age, sources of information and media extend to news on sub-reddits, Facebook groups and Instagram channels, all of which have significant following. Even assuming for a moment that news in hard print de facto qualifies as mainstream, there are different levels of readership for different languages of newspapers. Therefore this begs the question of “how mainstream is mainstream enough?” Clarity on this aspect is imperative as this will affect the reach of such disclosures to investors. Tweaking the Proposal To make SEBI’s proposal work, one can take cue from listing rule 703(3) of the Singapore Exchange’s Mainboard Rules. It mentions that if “(a) the information concerns an incomplete proposal or negotiation; [or] (b) the information comprises matters of supposition or is insufficiently definite to warrant disclosure; [or] (c) the information is generated for the internal management purposes of the entity; [or] (d) the information is a trade secret”, the issuer would not need to announce any information which is likely to affect the price or the value of the security and would not need to clarify anything in relation to a rumor. Drawing reference from such a rule would lead to a more optimal framework for disclosures of market rumors. This is because points (a) and (b) of the listing rule (specified above) would take into account of the uncertainty of deals. Moreover, such a framework would provide for a disclosure mechanism the moment the deals become certain enough, and when the proposals or negotiations become complete. Such a mid-way solution would benefit investors and companies alike. Thereby, this seems to be a workable solution which has clearly delineated the stage of negotiation at which the disclosure would have to be made. Furthermore, on the timeline of disclosure, one may pay heed to Appendix 7.1 of the SGX Rules relating to “Corporate Disclosure Policy”. Part VI of the same stipulates that the clarification or confirmation of rumors would have to be promptly. Reading this with Part VIII, it would lead us to understand that such information would have to be disclosed as and when it arises, even if it is during trading hours. To ensure a thorough dissemination of such a disclosure, the Exchange would expect the issuer to request a trading halt of at least 30 minutes and such a request would have to be announced. A temporary suspension of trading in the shares of the company may also be requested to this end by the issuer. The Appendix has also provided for where such disclosures need to be made, and in Part IX has also specified a guideline in relation to the preparation of the public announcement. One may also take reference from the United States in this regard. In Greenfield v. Heublein, Inc., a bright line test was laid down in terms of a duty of disclosure. The Court held that any kind of negotiations (in relation to a merger) would not have to be disclosed until an agreement in-principle has been reached. By an “agreement in-principle”, it was meant that an agreement vis-a-vis the price and structure of the new company. From the transplant of the abovementioned mechanisms, SEBI may be able to cater interests from both sides of the spectrum. Conclusion As observed in the Jio-Facebook deal, market rumors and the price of shares are co-related. However a pre-mature confirmation or denial of the existence of the deal itself would bite the investors in the back, as deals may fall through any time. The solution here is not to absolutely do away with such disclosures. Rather, taking cue from existing frameworks outside India, SEBI may create certain checkpoints at which the disclosures have to be made. This would ensure that disclosures of such events occur and that information parity is maintained, which is not at the cost of unnecessarily intervening in the deal-making process and imposing additional compliance burden on the companies. – Harsh N Dudhe Disclosure Requirements SEBI Securities Regulation"

            "Does the expression “charges” always include demurrage? Supreme Court answers in the negative By GuestJanuary 15, 202310 Min readAdd comment   [Raghav Bhatia is an advocate, practising at the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court, and Mahima Tahiliani is a third-year law student at UPES Dehradun] Recently, in Food Corporation of India v. Abhijit Paul, the Supreme Court of India [‘SC’] has observed that the expression “charges” does not include demurrage ipso facto and the same has to be determined in light of the terms of contract between the parties. The authors believe that this decision is not only in the right direction but will also provide much needed clarity to commercial parties going forward.  Factual Background Food Corporation of India [‘FCI’] had entered into a contract with Abhijit Paul [‘contractor’] for transportation of food grains from the railway siding of Churaibari, Assam to the food security depot of Chandrapur, Tripura “on a regular basis for a period of two years”. A sum of Rs. 44,95,000/- was deposited by the contractor as security deposit. The contract between the parties stood discharged by performance in July 2014. By a letter dated December 22, 2015, followed by a notice, FCI “called upon the contractor to reimburse the amount of demurrages imposed on it by the Railways”. Demurrage is an amount payable when goods from the port are not cleared within the agreed time period. Thus, demurrage is levied for ensuring timely clearance of the cargo from the port. The reason for claiming such reimbursement in this case, as explained in the letter dated June 27, 2017, was that due to the contractor’s inability to readily provide trucks at the Railway sidings, FCI was prevented from unloading the food grains within the time period allotted by the Railways. Therefore, FCI sought to recover demurrage from the contractor by withholding the security deposit provided by him. The contractor objected to the same on the ground that FCI had no right under the contract to recover demurrage. Accordingly, the contractor filed a writ petition before the High Court of Tripura [‘HC’]. The Single Judge allowed the writ petition, observing that FCI was only entitled to recover losses that it faced “due to the contractor’s dereliction of duties under the contract, as permissible under Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872” and losses that had no relationship with the contractor’s actions could not have been recovered. It was also observed that since FCI could not have unilaterally determined and imposed demurrage on the contractor, it was directed to file a civil suit to recover its claims. Aggrieved, both FCI and the contractor preferred appeals before the division bench of the HC, which were dismissed. Aggrieved, both the parties approached the SC. Issue before the SC The issue was “whether the contractual clause enabling the Corporation to recover “charges” includes the recovery of demurrage”? Proceedings before the SC At the outset, the SC noted that FCI sought to recover demurrage as a part of “charges” under clause XII(a) of the contract. Clause XII of the contract pertains to recovery of losses suffered by the FCI. It reads as: “The Corporationshall be at liberty to reimburse themselves for any damages, losses, charges, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by them, or any amount payable by the Contractor as Liquidated Damages as provided in Clauses X above. The total sum claimed shall be deducted from any sum then due, or which at any time thereafter may become due, to the Contractors under this, or any other, Contract with the Corporation. In the event of the sum which may be due from the Contractor as aforesaid being insufficient, the balance of the total sum claimed and recoverable from the Contractors as aforesaid shall be deducted from the Security Deposit, furnished by the contractor as specified in Clause IX…” (emphasis added). Clause XII(a) has to be read with clauses X and XIII. While clause X provides for the contractor’s liability for losses suffered by the FCI, clause XIII provides for the contractor’s responsibilities. Clause X(a) reads as: “The Contractor shall be liable for all costs, damages, registration fees, charges and expenses suffered or incurred by the Corporation due to the Contractor’s negligence and unworkmanlike performance of any services under this Contract, or breach of any terms of the Contract, or failure to carry out the work under the Contract, and for all damages or losses occasioned to the Corporation, or in particular to any property or plant belonging to the Corporation, due to any act whether negligent or otherwise, of the Contractor or his employees…” (emphasis added). Clause XIII reads as: (a) The Contractor shall be responsible to supply adequate and sufficient number of trucks for transportation of food grains and carrying out any other services under the Contract in accordance with the instructions issued by the General Manager or an officer acting on his behalf.  …(f) The Contractor shall be responsible for the safety of the goods from the time they are loaded on their truck from godowns/mandis/rail heads until they have been unloaded from the trucks at godowns or at other destinations as specified in the Contract or as directed by the General Manager/Area Manager or any other officer acting on his behalf…”. The SC observed that the expression “charges” on its own does not have a single definition. It is an expression which is open to interpretation and thus its meaning must be understood “as intended by the parties to the contract”. After a perusal of the contract’s preamble, as per which the contractor was engaged for “transportation of foodgrains from depots, mandis, rail heads of Churaibari to various destinations as per appendix 1” and clauses X, XII and XIII, the SC observed that there is “no contractual provision requiring the contractors to undertake the task of loading and unloading of foodgains from the railway wagons”. Even in its written submissions, FCI had admitted that it sought to impose demurrage only because the contractor failed to “provide adequate number of trucks near the railway sidings, to enable the Corporation to promptly hand over the foodgrains to them to commence transportation”. Thus, the task of loading or unloading of foodgrains from the railway wagons was not a part of the contract. In light of the above, the SC concluded that the expression “charges” in the present case did not include demurrage. Further, the SC pressed into service the concept of latent ambiguity. As per latent ambiguity, expressions used in a contract might appear to be free from ambiguity. However, when they are to be interpreted in light of a specific question, such as in the present case, the expressions are amenable to multiple outcomes. In light of the aforesaid concept, the SC observed that in a contract entered into by FCI in 2010 and in another contract entered into by FCI in 2018, there were specific clauses which provided for imposition of demurrage. Accordingly, the SC held that the present contract between the parties is distinct as FCI has not included any clause to collect demurrage from the contractor. Earlier judgments of the SC, such as Raichand Amulakh Shah v. Union of India  and Trustees of the Port of Madras v. Aminchand Pyarelal, holding that demurrage is a charge, were rightly distinguished by the SC in the instant case by observing that textual understanding of a concept cannot be of any help while deciphering “the true and correct intention of the parties to the present case”. Analysis  The authors’ submit that the instant judgment is in the right direction. A perusal of different clauses of the contract clearly delineated the scope of the contractor’s duties under the contract. The charge was payable by the contractor only upon dereliction of his duties, which was not the scenario in the instant case as per the SC. The fact that FCI expressly included power to recover demurrage in some of the other contracts further helped in arriving at the aforesaid conclusion. Having said that, the SC missed an opportunity to discuss in detail the two judgments that were cited by FCI to argue that “charges” include demurrage. In Raichand, the SC was interpreting Section 46-C(d) of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 which defined demurrage as “charge levied after the expiry of the free time allowed for loading or unloading a wagon”. Thus, in Raichand, it was in the context of a statutory definition that the SC had observed that demurrage is a type of a charge. Similarly, in Aminchand, the SC, in the context of Section 42 of the Madras Port Trust Act, 1905 (‘MPT Act’), observed that demurrage is a charge and not a service and also placed reliance on the bye-laws framed under the MPT Act to explain the context in which demurrage was defined under Section 42 of the MPT Act. Thus, both in Raichand and Aminchand, the SC was not discussing the ambit of the expression “charges” used in a commercial contract between the parties, and therefore, both the decisions were rightly distinguished. In the instant case, as rightly pointed out by the SC, the expression “charges” was required to be understood in light of the contractually agreed obligations of the parties. This judgment is another illustration in recent times of the SC refusing to interfere with the contractually agreed terms between the parties. In Indian Oil Corporation v. Shree Ganesh Petroleum (discussed, here), the SC had explained its limited jurisdiction in interfering with the contractually agreed terms. Interestingly, the SC in the instant case did not discuss the issue of availability of trucks and merely observed that there was a dispute “about the availability of trucks”. In Hadley v. Baxendale, the first limb of damages rule was explained as where “two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it”. Only a trial between the parties could have revealed whether trucks were indeed available or not. The authors believe that if the trucks were not available, FCI could have successfully invoked the first limb of Hadley v. Baxendale to claim damages. Failure to provide trucks would naturally result in FCI being liable for demurrage as it would be unable to unload the food grains in time from the Railway sidings. Conclusion With this judgment, the SC has rightly given pre-eminence to the contractually agreed terms between the parties. It will be interesting to see if commercial entities, including government authorities, are more careful about the specific terms of the contract in future after the recent trend of the SC refusing to interfere with express terms of the contract. – Raghav Bhatia & Mahima Tahiliani Contract Law"

        "title": "The Regulatory Progression of ESG in India",
        "read_on_content": [
            "The Regulatory Progression of ESG in India By Umakanth VarottilJanuary 14, 20238 Min readAdd comment   The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has had a pivotal status in the debates surrounding corporate law and governance at the turn of the century. Although CSR was ensconced in the idea of voluntarism by which companies and their boards are invited to pay attention to the interests of various constituencies affected by a company’s activities, in some jurisdictions such as India it has also acquired the status of a legal obligation. However, a recent strain of literature has identified that the broader sustainability concerns surrounding corporate governance have focused more on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, and away from CSR as traditionally understood. While ESG is generally considered to be market-driven, corporate and securities regulators around the world are beginning to modulate the ESG-orientation through legal or regulatory instruments, especially when it comes to ESG reporting. Such a phenomenon has also played out in India, the jurisdiction of study of my recent working paper “The Legal and Regulatory Impetus towards ESG in India: Developments and Challenges”. Other authors such as Rudresh Mandal and Ashwin Murthy too explore this trend. The developments in India merit greater analysis for a number of reasons: at around 1.4 billion, it is one of the most populous countries in the world; it not only attracts significant foreign investment, but several Indian companies compete in the global product (and services) and capital markets; its experiments with the role of stakeholders in corporate have has garnered attention on the global stage. While both CSR and ESG continue to coexist in India, due to certain peculiar connotations of CSR in that jurisdiction, the regulatory focus has shifted more towards ESG in recent years. First, it is clear that nowhere has CSR acquired a more prescriptive status than in India where the basic corporate statute, the Companies Act 2013 is rather elaborate about the obligations of companies to act in a manner that benefits the broader society, apart from shareholders. Second, India is one of only a handful of jurisdictions to require large companies to spend a stipulated amount—at least two per cent of average net profits made during the three immediately preceding financial years—in pursuance of their CSR policy towards specified activities. While the Companies Act 2013 initially stipulated that the obligation was to be implemented on a ‘comply-or-explain’ basis, amendments to the legislation in 2019 have altered its status into one of a legal mandate. To that extent, CSR in India is largely concerned with companies contributing a minimum amount of money towards social activities, thereby equating CSR with corporate philanthropy’. Third, and owing to its largely philanthropic tilt, the CSR regime in India fails to focus on the negative externalities generated by the regular business operations of companies, which has conventionally been captured within the domain of CSR elsewhere. Given the conceptual dissatisfaction surrounding CSR in India (see here and here), the emerging trend of ESG takes on great importance. Against this background, the goal of the aforementioned paper is to build upon the transition outlined in the scholarly debates from CSR to ESG. Although ESG is well-understood to be market-driven, the paper focuses instead on the legal and regulatory measures governing ESG factors in India. It, therefore, examines the developments and challenges surrounding ESG in India along three fronts. First, the paper explores the roles and responsibilities of corporate boards in accounting for ESG factors in their decision-making process. Second, and relatedly, it analyses the obligations of companies to engage in disclosure and reporting on ESG matters. Finally, viewed from the investor perspective, it examines ESG considerations that underpin the shareholder stewardship regime in India. Directors’ Duties and ESG Considerations Prevalent corporate governance debates shine the light on the need for greater emphasis on long-term sustainable value as opposed to the pursuit of profits solely for the benefit of shareholders. Such ESG considerations have also received extensive support from the investor community on the basis that the longer-term interests of shareholders as well as other stakeholders enjoy a great deal of alignment. Under such a dispensation, companies and their directors bear a duty to act to protect the long-term sustainable value for a broader range of constituencies beyond shareholders. Such an approach has been deep-rooted in Indian corporate policy making for over half a century. Consistent with the socialistic policies prevalent in India in the 1960, the role of corporate law went beyond a mere consideration of shareholder interests, and recognised the need to ensure protection of other constituencies such as employees, creditors, consumers and society. One finds the best reflection of this approach in the codification of directors’ duties in section 166(2) of the Companies Act 2013, which provides that the directors of a company shall act in good faith and in the best interests of the company, its employees, the shareholders, the community and the for the protection of the environment. Here, the paper makes two assertions: that (i) section 166(2) resonates with the financial model of shareholder-driven ESG in that it requires directors to consider the long-term interests of the company rather than the short-term interests; and (ii) the provision also requires directors to specifically account for the interests of non-shareholder constituencies, which comports with the entity model of ESG. An important duty of the directors also relates to transparency. ESG Disclosures and Reporting  Historically, Indian law lacked a consistent framework for ESG reporting, although some companies did undertake disclosures on a voluntary basis. Over time, though, more defined requirements emanated for reporting on ESG risks. ESG reporting in India can be categorised into two parts: (i) general ‘materiality’ related disclosures; and (ii) business responsibility and sustainability reporting (‘BRSR’). As for the first aspect, although cast in the context of primary market transactions, a broad interpretation of the concept of ‘materiality’ has the effect of expanding the disclosure obligations in the secondary markets as well. Hence, any requirement to disclose climate-related information based on the principle of materiality must be viewed in this context. Overall, such a materiality-based disclosure is premised on introducing transparency on ESG (and other) matters that affect the decision-making of the investors, thereby making it consistent with the financial model of ESG. As for the second aspect relating to BRSR, there has been considerable regulatory development in this regard, spearheaded by both the Ministry of Corporate Affairs as well as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The new framework, which requires the top 1,000 listed companies to mandatorily engage in BRSR, has been found to be a step in the right direction, which encourages companies to be socially and ethically responsible. At the same time, it is clear that the BRSR framework is still work-in-progress. Overall, the BRSR approach is less focused on risk to investors, and is aimed at generating wider disclosures that may benefit shareholders as well as other stakeholders. If the materiality-based reporting discussed earlier connects more closely with the financial model of ESG, the BRSR is more overarching to encompass the entity model of ESG as well. Not surprisingly, a number of challenges remain, as outlined in the paper. Shareholder Stewardship and ESG Stewardship codes have proliferated around the world over the last decade or so, and the Indian regulators have jumped on the bandwagon as well. These codes focus on the role that institutional investors play as stewards of the companies in which they invest. In some cases, the stewardship codes also expressly recognise the need for investors to go beyondmerely considering shareholder interests and take into account ESG matters. Interestingly, the concept of ESG is inherent in the stewardship codes issued by the three Indian regulatory, namely the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, and SEBI. Although several challenges remain, as outlined in the paper, there has been a significant move in recent years towards ESG investing in India. The regulators have followed suit to establish a stewardship regime, albeit a fragmented one. Although ESG is explicitly incorporated as part of the considerations for stewardship engagement by institutional investors with their investee companies, it only takes into account the financial risk-based approach towards ESG and not the more entity-oriented formulation that is more consistent with the stakeholder responsibility of corporate boards in India. This area necessitates a regulatory reevaluation. Conclusion India’s focus on directors’ duties to consider shareholders as well as other constituencies lay a strong statutory foundation for the legal recognition of ESG, both on a financial basis and an entity approach. Coupled with this are strong regulatory moves by the Indian financial regulators (including SEBI) to develop ESG reporting and to encapsulate ESG concerns as part of shareholder stewardship initiatives. Although there have been significant legislative and regulatory measures towards ESG in India, several challenges remain, and the efforts thus far can only be considered to be work-in-progress.

            "Government AI Procurement in India: Can WEF Guidelines Solve the Latency? By GuestJanuary 12, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Jishnu M Nair is a Senior Attorney at IBM] With a score of 63.67, India is at the 32nd position in the Government AI readiness Index 2022, issued by Oxford Insights. The index symbolizes that India is more policy-ready than Brazil and Greece, and less policy-ready than China and Malaysia. Although 32 might not be a desirable rank, for a developing nation to be in the first 25% of the countries in the world in terms of ranking indicates India’s consistent efforts, especially that of the central policymaking body, NITI Aayog. The economic benefit of artificial intelligence (AI) is proven beyond doubt. It is also important to note the impact on the layperson. For the 1.3 billion people in India and especially the 845 million rural population, this would mean financial inclusion, better traffic administration, faster processing of tax forms, or better access to a health infrastructure. Technologies such as AI can resolve several of India’s challenges, and it makes sense for India to prioritize policymaking in this area. The Indian Strategy on AI India’s national strategy on AI and the work towards a more centralized policy are in the right direction. However, India’s lack of experience and a cautious approach have impacted its agility to implement these technologies. Banning a practical innovation is a general norm by many governments worldwide. If you don’t understand something, then you ban it. NITI Aayog deserves credit for taking a more positive step in this direction. These promising developments raise questions about what accountable and ethical AI deployment in India would look like. Like any other technological innovation, AI is full of challenges for regulators. An instance of concern about AI is facial recognition technology (FRT), one of the most controversial of AI technologies. FRT is supposed to be used with legal authority, regulation, and oversight. The possibility of violating fundamental rights such as the right to privacy, freedom of speech and expression, and the right to protest peacefully, is high. A step in this direction was IBM’s call to ban technologies like FRT for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of fundamental human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which does not align with the stated principles regarding trust and transparency for AI. A case study on this is the tender released by the National Crime Records Bureau under the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs, which seeks to adopt a facial recognition system called the National Automated Facial Recognition System. The expectation was to create a surveillance tool by linking crime databases and facial recognition. There are assertions that the Home Affairs ministry structured the tender without considering privacy impacts or considering topics such as discrimination, feasibility, and exclusion caused by such facial recognition technology used by the Government, which are, by their very nature, mass surveillance measures. In India, specific laws about FRT or personal data protection do not exist. Supreme Court’s Views The Indian Supreme Court, in its landmark judgment of Justice KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India, laid down principles under which privacy is recognized as a fundamental right and included a need to have legislative safeguards to protect privacy, especially for the data set available to technologies. AI implemented without legislative principles or executive guidance violates the Indian Supreme Court’s decision.  On the one hand, India ought not to be in a situation where it blindly rejects new-age technologies and their implementation. It needs regulated sandboxes to provide a safe and regulated environment for the technologies to be researched and implemented. India does not have any form of framework on how government departments can structure technology procurement. There is indicative guidance for technology procurement issued by the Ministry of Information Technology, which is rarely followed while departments make their procurement. AI is increasingly adopted in India across various sectors. The government of Andhra Pradesh has implemented a project called “Precision Farming using Drones and AI” to help farmers optimize the use of resources such as water and fertilizers. Drones with sensors collect data on soil conditions and crop growth, which is then analysed using AI algorithms to provide recommendations on optimal resource use. The Tamil Nadu Government is helping farmers to diagnose the pest infection in their crops and provide them with remedial measures. A farmer can click a picture of the pest-infected crop even with a low-cost mobile camera and upload it to the Uzhavan app. Once the photo is uploaded, the inbuilt intelligent system analyses and identifies the pest and sends the remedial measures as a text message in Tamil to the farmer’s phone. Another effort in public works is a low-cost rural ‘drinking water supply monitoring system’ that will give a daily report on the drinking water supply in rural Tamil Nadu. It is a low-cost rural drinking water supply and monitoring system using cost-effective IoT sensors. Another example is the Indian Railways using AI to predict equipment failures and prevent accidents. AI algorithms analyse data from sensors on trains and track infrastructure to identify potential problems before they manifest, allowing maintenance to be carried out before failures occur. In another case, facial recognition is used in government offices and schools in India to track attendance and predict where attendance falls short. Many examples indicate that it is high time we move from conceptual discussions on creating guidelines for procurement to actual implementation. India has no policy framework for its prospective engagement with AI technologies. We need a uniform public procurement framework for AI, giving directions to government departments on AI-based technologies’ procurement. Government procurement rules and purchasing practices always strongly influence markets, particularly in their early development stages. The Government can use its moral authority and credibility to set the baseline and debate AI standards. Technology providers have working models to understand the existing algorithmic challenges, and the Government can look to them for their expertise to create a baseline. These technologies’ creators look to governments to create clarity and predictability about managing the challenges, including regulatory challenges. The AI industry will lead this part of the policymaking with government agencies. Governments must proactively shape AI technologies’ development and deployment, as this conversation cannot be left to the industry alone. Therefore, we need common-sense frameworks to help governments overcome reluctance and mistakes in procuring complex new technologies and tackle a new market. Transparency in guidelines would mean a level playing field for permitting established companies and new entrants to the AI space. India can consider emulating the existing World Economic Forum’s (WEF) AI Government Procurement Guidelines for its AI procurement activities in this context. What are the WEF AI Government Procurement Guidelines? The WEF AI government procurement guidelines (“WEF Guidelines” or “Guidelines”) set forth procurement processes that concentrate on outlining problems and opportunities and thereby leave room for iteration. The Guidelines have sought to address the concerns around AI, such as bias, privacy, accountability, transparency, and overall complexity. Amongst other things, the WEF Guidelines insist on creative procurement processes, including considering challenge-based procurement and establishing a well-constructed and detailed framework agreement that the suppliers can join. This would be a game-changer in a country like India, where we have multiple forms of government tenders. The other expectation is for the procuring organization (“PO”) to do an initial AI risk and impact assessment. The Guidelines also suggest that AI-powered solutions should stand on the pillar of transparency. In a procurement process, POs should expect the AI supplier to submit documentation regarding the development of the algorithm. The document should include headers like the data set used for development, whether the model is based on supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning, or any known biases. If an algorithm is building a process, especially an administrative process, it should be established with the supplier regarding how the general public can contest automated decision-making. We need to ensure that AI decision-making is as transparent as possible, explore mechanisms to enable interoperability of the algorithms internally and externally and provide no vendor lock-in. The Guidelines also expect clearly defined data governance mechanisms in place from the start of the procurement process. They ask that the procurement process consider the data’s susceptibility in scope and if its usage is fair. The vendors are expected to highlight known limitations (e.g., quality) of the tender data and require tenderers to describe their strategies to address these shortcomings. The guidelines also hope the PO makes ethical considerations part of their procurement process, especially evaluating the technicality around prospective suppliers’ proposals. The WEF Guidelines provide fundamental considerations a government should address before acquiring and deploying AI solutions and services. The Guidelines suggest structures that align with ethical principles and human rights. They explain steps to evaluate the potential risks and impacts of the AI system and put in place measures to mitigate any negative consequences. The Guidelines can also ensure that the procurement process is transparent and open and that relevant stakeholders are involved in the decision-making process, which in turn can ensure that the systems can be made explainable and accountable, with precise mechanisms in place for transparency and oversight. The Guidelines themselves say they are not intended as a silver bullet for solving all public sector AI adoption challenges. Still, by influencing how new AI solutions are procured, they can set government use and adoption of AI on a better path. Although the WEF Guidelines might not work in their entirety in India, the critical pillars defined above can be the guiding force in building up an effective regime for the Indian government’s foray into AI procurement. – Jishnu M Nair Artificial Intelligence Contract Law International Developments"

            "Schrems II: Data Flow to Trusted Jurisdictions and Implications for India By GuestJanuary 11, 20238 Min readAdd comment   [Intisar Aslam is a 2nd Year B.A., LL.B. (Hons.) student at the National University of Study and Research in Law in Ranchi] The much-awaited Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022 (“DPDP”), released by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (“Meity”), has received mixed reactions from the legal fraternity. Previously, the Data Protection Bill, 2022 (“DPB”) was withdrawn owing to the suggestion of a large number of amendments. In the words of the Government, a “comprehensive legal framework” addressing the evolution of the digital ecosystem was required. Another reason was that the previous Bill was “compliant intensive” for small-scale start-ups. With simplified language, hefty fines, and cross-border data flow, it seems that the Bill heralds a new beginning of digital privacy in India. However, clause 17 of the DPDP Bill, which relates to data transfer outside the Indian territory fails to pass muster considering a judgment of the European Union. This post seeks to analyze whether the provision of cross-border data flow passes the test of Schrems II judgment of the European Union. The ruling stands relevant for India as it not only relates to the free flow of data but also aligns with India’s aim of playing a significant role in the global ‘digital’ trade regime. On the contrary, localization of data poses a threat to innovation and places a high infrastructure and financial burden on businesses. Thus, the trust-based approach of Schrems II serves both the purposes of India: digital data protection and the flourishing of international trade and innovation. Further, this might also lead to India being recognized by the EU as having adequate data protection standards, therebyfacilitating transactions between the two jurisdictions. The post proceeds in two parts. First, it enumerates the principles and the recommendations laid down in Schrems II and by the European Data Protection Board respectively. Second, it analyses the provision of cross-border data flow from two lenses: first, from the lens of Schrems II principles, and second, from the lens of the recommendations provided by the European Data Protection Board while simultaneously establishing the feasibility of data protection in the cross-border data flow from India. Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland: The Case which Set the Ball Rolling This case, popularly known as Schrems II, laid down certain principles for the cross-border transfer of personal data from the European Union. In its ruling, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) invalidated the European Commission’s Privacy Shield Decision due to intrusive US surveillance programs. It rendered the transfers of personal data made in reliance on the Privacy Shield Decision unlawful. The Court laid down stricter requirements for the transfer of personal data based on standard contract clauses (“SCCs”). It further held that the level of protection offered by data controllers or processors who want to transmit data based on SCCs must be “essentially equivalent” to that offered by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (“CFR”) and, if necessary, with additional steps to make up for gaps in the legal systems of third countries. Any deviation from the same would result in the stoppage of transfer of personal data outside of the EU. More specifically, the CJEU laid down the following principles to be followed by the data processors and data controllers before the cross-border transfer of data can be effected: (i) whether the other country (in this case, the US) provided the same level of protection to the data subject, i.e., the EU resident as that provided by the EU; (ii) whether the access of the Government of the country where the data has been transferred (in this case, the US Government) to data is proportionate and strictly necessary to the legitimate objectives it pursues to achieve; (iii) whether effective legal remedies were available to EU data subjects; and (iv) whether there is independent oversight. The Initial Test of Schrems II: The Test of ‘Essentially Equivalent’ Principle The DPDP Bill allows for the transfer of personal data outside India. Clause 17 lays down that “the Central Government may, after an assessment of such factors as it may consider necessary, notify such countries or territories outside India to which a Data Fiduciary may transfer personal data, in accordance with such terms and conditions as may be specified.” Considering the rationale given by the CJEU, i.e., that the level of protection must be “essentially equivalent”, the provision becomes a cause of concern. Firstly, the DPDP Bill does not clarify the grounds on which a particular jurisdiction would be considered a trusted jurisdiction for the transfer of data. Secondly, in case the Government opts for the “essentially equivalent” principle, it fails to consider whether developing or underdeveloped jurisdictions like Africa, would be able to make it to notified jurisdictions. If not, then such disruption of data flow would cause serious harm to cross-border business in both India and other jurisdictions. Thirdly, the removal of the distinction between sensitive personal data and critical personal data is another bottleneck halting the smooth implementation of the draft Bill. The previous drafts proposed a local storage obligation for sensitive personal data and a “hard” localization obligation for an undefined category of critical personal data. The broad extent of data covered coupled with the lack of clarity on the manner and extent of sharing permitted, and its subsequent cross-border flow, are prone to serious implications of misuse of any kind of data – sensitive or critical- by any foreign jurisdiction. The Final Test of European Data Protection Board (EDPB): The Test of ‘Essential Guarantees’ Principle The ‘essential guarantees’ are requirements that a third country must have in place when processing EU residents’ data. These include, firstly, that the processing of data must be based on clear and precise rules with the data subject having the knowledge of the circumstances in which the data controllers or processors can process the data of an individual. Secondly, the intrusion must be necessary and proportionate to the objective sought to be achieved. This is akin to the principle adopted by the Supreme Court in the KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India. Thirdly, an independent oversight mechanism to oversee such intrusion must exist. Lastly, one must consider whether there are effective legal remedies available in case of an intrusion. In the present DPDP Bill, the first and the second recommendation shall depend upon the authority having control over the data and the aim of processing data respectively. Therefore, these remain subjective and will vary on a case-to-case basis. The point at which the DPDP Bill falls out of line with the EDPB Recommendations is the establishment of an independent Data Protection Board of India (“DPBI”). Clause 19 of the DPDP Bill provides for the establishment of DPBI while offering powers of selection, removal, and composition, of the Board to the Central Government. Thus, the requirement of having an “independent oversight” body remains unfulfilled. This also leads to the second point of incongruence vis-à-vis Schrems II where it found the privacy ombudsman to be inadequate as the ombudsman was in some way part of the US executive. The DPBI, in its present stature, is more of a direction-issuing body when a breach reaches its knowledge, rather than an oversight one which itself takes actions on its own motion. As for the last recommendation, the DPDP Bill has set hefty fines in case of personal data breaches. At the same time, it is yet to be seen how well the first two recommendations are met especially when the second one aligns with the direction of the Supreme Court in K.S. Puttaswamy. Thus, it is uncertain if there will be any supervision by the DPBI vis-à-vis cross-border data breaches, and the subsequent cognizance on its own motion. Further, it is unclear whether the DPBI would also oversee that adequate protection is continued to be offered in the trusted jurisdiction throughout the processing of data beyond the Indian borders. Conclusion The DPDP Bill is unique in several aspects for India. However, the draft weakens the regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement structure by replacing the previously proposed data protection authority with a board that will be directly in control of the government. Further, the procedure that the Government will adopt to ensure that the protection offered by such a notified jurisdiction is “essentially equivalent” to that offered by India is uncertain. Additionally, the assurance that there is no scope for withdrawal of or diminishing the level of protection offered to the data subjects by the notified jurisdiction under any circumstances is either absent or only speculative. Unlike its predecessor, the DPDP Bill has skipped mentioning ‘Right to Privacy’ in its Preamble, which is the very essence of any data protection legislation across the world. Such instances are disconcerting. While India treads the path towards a new and long-awaited digital data protection era, it is imperative that the Bill falls in line with the CJEU principles which remain one of the most standard benchmarks for data protection in the world. – Intisar Aslam Data Privacy International Developments"

            "SEBI’s Proposed Disclosure Regime: Impact on Public M&A and Directors’ Liabilities By GuestJanuary 7, 20239 Min readAdd comment   [Shivam Yadav, Amudavalli Kannan, and Shreyas Bhushan are with Resolut Partners] Institutional investors, listed companies, and retail shareholders – three key market participants – will be watching SEBI with eagle-eyes while it attempts to implement a new disclosure regime, as set out in its recent consultation paper (Consultation Paper). Most of SEBI’s proposals are well-intentioned and workable. If at all, SEBI (and other market players) must remain cautious of the risks the proposals potentially open up. Flooding the market with too much information, increased liabilities for directors, and challenges for strategic and financial investors may compromise many of the benefits which the changes seek to bring. In this post, we analyse certain key changes proposed and their potential effect on key market players. From standards to rules: what has changed?  Mandatory disclosure of mainstream media reports SEBI has proposed that the top 250 listed entities must “necessarily confirm or deny any event or information reported in mainstream media… which may have a material effect on the listed entity under this regulation.” The law currently leaves this to the discretion of the listed entity. SEBI’s rationale for the change seems to be that market rumours may fuel false market sentiment and adversely impact price discovery, thereby impacting public shareholders. In an ideal world, this would be great for public shareholders. However, the proposal presents three key issues. First, there is a presumption that the media will necessarily act in the best interests of the public and listed companies. As the proposal stands today, all media reports may just have to be clarified by listed companies (since the term ‘mainstream media’ remains undefined), which may have the effect of giving the media a free hand to push listed companies to disclose information which may be uncertain or in primitive stages and which may be for the benefit of certain vested interests. Ultimately, public shareholders who make decisions on the basis of incomplete information will suffer if the listed company decides to make a decision the other way. Second, it is unclear how much and how frequently a media rumour should be clarified, and whether listed companies need to continuously provide updates thereafter. If the media has only picked up on certain parts of a deal, it is uncertain whether the listed company should clarify only those parts or everything on the deal – since a partial disclosure may be viewed by SEBI as an incomplete disclosure. Next, let us say the listed company has gone ahead and responded to rumours about a potential contract that it intends to enter into. The contract is supposed to be signed three months later, but several developments take place in that time span, significantly changing the contours of the agreement (e.g., a 30% discount). Are listed companies also obligated to continuously disclose each such development – because the public markets will presume, and possibly rely on, the validity of the last disclosure? Finally, even if listed companies wanted to disclose information, there is the concern of external information (e.g., Alibaba’s stake sale in Zomato) which the listed company may not know about. Are they expected to disclose such events as well? These questions currently remain unanswered – and insofar as the consequence may be an incomplete or partial disclosure, there remains a risk of a false market potentially being created. Third, deal and price certainty are founded on the touchstone of confidentiality. If market leaks are responded to, deal prices (which are calculated on a look-back basis under listing regulations) shoot up, potentially making the deal unviable. This provides market players an avenue to abuse the process and further complicate deal-making. The impact of a deal being called off is not just on investors and listed companies. Public shareholders may take up media reports on potential deals and invest into the company, only to discover the basis for their investment was misplaced. The risk then is not just of compromised deal certainty, as disclosure of uncertain transactions also contributes to the creation of a false market. Objective thresholds for materiality Under existing law, certain events use objective thresholds to determine whether an event is ‘material’, thus warranting disclosure. For other events, the law intentionally retains a subjective threshold, allowing listed companies discretion to decide whether an event is ‘material’ or not. For the latter set of events, SEBI has now proposed to also include objective thresholds as well: if the ‘expected impact’ of such an event exceeds the financial thresholds in SEBI’s proposal[1], it must be disclosed (although SEBI has not clarified how it has arrived at these specific percentages). The aim seems to be to avoid subjectivity and provide certainty to public shareholders. However, the risk is two-fold. On the one hand, we may see over-disclosure. For example, a technology company with a turnover of INR 5000 crore and a net worth of INR 500 crore would have a threshold of INR 10 crore for materiality, which could trigger events immaterial to the overall business, such as termination of housekeeping services across multiple offices. Immaterial disclosures may flood the market with information and may result in retail investors missing out on events which are actually material. On the other hand, we may see a counter-productive result as well, where highly material events are not disclosed to the market purely because they do not the meet the objective thresholds prescribed under law, thus diluting any flexibility or value that a subjective threshold contributes (e.g., sale of an undervalued business vertical which has a strong future value). Does this mean SEBI should completely do away with a numerical threshold? Not necessarily, as there are grounds to justify a hybrid approach – where the existing materiality thresholds are retained as is, with the added stipulation of well-reasoned, objective thresholds which do not result in market flooding. A combination of these should help take care of some of these concerns. Director/ KMP liabilities – doomed if you do; doomed if you don’t SEBI’s intent could not have possibly been to increase directors’ or key managerial personnels’ (KMP) liabilities in ambiguous situations. However, if the current proposals are implemented as-is, this is the likely consequence as several ambiguities in the proposals have left directors and KMP in a rather precarious position. Take, for example, the obligation to disclose material events e.g., regulatory actions, if their “expected impact” crosses the proposed thresholds. There is no clarity on how to calculate the expected impact. If the actual impact of a disclosed event turns out to be higher than their initial communication to the market, then directors and KMPs risk opening themselves up to significant liability (in certain cases, penalties of several lakhs rupees and prohibitions on entering listed markets). They may even decide to not disclose an event which they calculate as having a low expected impact, but the which ends up becoming much higher. Similarly, the obligation to “confirm or deny” market rumours also puts directors on the spotlight. As we have highlighted here, directors or KMP may become liable for market manipulation or fuelling market speculation if they confirm a market rumour about a deal which subsequently falls through. The market has received incomplete information (even if the disclosure caveats that the deal is subject to negotiations) and may act on the expectation that it becomes true. As a consequence, directors may also have a fiduciary duty to continuously keep updating the market on media rumours, with uncertainty on how frequently or to what extent such disclosures are required. Then, directors are cornered into a dilemma of whether they should preserve deal sanctity or risk potential liability at SEBI’s hands. As a result, we expect an uptick in D&O insurance, especially where institutional investors are concerned. Boards would also do well to prepare proactive and reactive strategies in advance, which will enable them to respond appropriately in situations that may warrant disclosures. Similarly, listed companies may consider setting out parameters for calculating materiality and expected impacts in their materiality policy; such an upfront clarification in the policy may avoid regulatory scrutiny when a disclosure is actually made. Other key changes worth noting No more ‘shopping’ for the right rating: SEBI has now mandated that all credit ratings should be disclosed, whether new, revised, requested or not. This should be beneficial for both retail and strategic or financial investors. SEBI had formally reasoned that rating agencies disclose ratings online even if they are withdrawn and the changes should be viewed as an effort towards information parity – but the history around abuse of credit ratings may suggest that SEBI is attempting to solve for a more systemic issue. Exemptions for wholly owned subsidiaries: Transactions between a listed company and their wholly owned subsidiaries have been granted various exemptions under SEBI’s current rules. The Consultation Paper however has opened up the question on whether they should be scrutinised further. As we have analysed here, such transactions may not always be beneficial for public shareholders as they may result in value-accretive businesses moving away from the public eye and may result in value leakages for shareholders. While mandating disclosures of such transactions may not solve for these concerns entirely, it may just be SEBI’s first step towards further oversight. – Shivam Yadav, Amudavalli Kannan & Shreyas Bhushan   [1] Based on the last audited standalone financial statements of the listed entity, such an event is proposed to be ‘material’ and needs to be disclosed if the lower of the following thresholds are crossed: (a) 2% of turnover; (b) 2% of net-worth; or (c) 5% of absolute value of post-tax of profit/loss for the past 3 years.

            "Relaxation for Flip Structures under the New Overseas Investment Regime By GuestJanuary 5, 20236 Min readAdd comment   [Shubh Gautam is a fourth year B.A.LL.B (Hons) student at Chanakya National Law University, Patna] Indian startups and new age companies are jumping on the bandwagon of ‘flipping’ their business. This trend has been addressed by the Foreign Exchange Management (Overseas Investment) Rules, 2022 issued on August 22, 2022 (forming a part of the new overseas investment regime). The new overseas investment rules and regulations have ushered a liberal investment regime in India which will contribute to improving the ease of doing business. Several amendments and improvements have been brought over the old regime. For startups, the most significant one is the permission given to Indian entities to invest in foreign entities which have a subsidiary in India. This permission effectively provides a relaxation to Indian entities to flip their business. What is a Flip?  A ‘flip’ structure or a round-tripping structure refers to a corporate inversion of a company. The company incorporates a holding company in a foreign jurisdiction with a favourable environment for business and the shares of the company are transferred to the holding company. In effect, the company becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of the foreign company. When a company flips, it changes its domicile. For instance, when an Indian start-up with its business in India flips through a holding company incorporated in the USA, its business remains intact in India, but it becomes a USA-based company. The choice of foreign jurisdiction is based on several factors, considering the present and future needs of the business. Some markets are more mature and consolidated in terms of providing easy access to capital, conducive legal compliances, liberal tax and regulatory regimes, and well-developed intellectual property (IP) and data protection laws. The USA, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Maturities are some of the popular jurisdictions where companies prefer to flip. The primary consideration for the flip is easy access to capital and a conducive business environment. With limited investment options in India, startups have started to realise the importance of capturing global attention for broadening their investment pool. The holding company acts as a vehicle for investment so that the partners and other investors can focus on bringing investment to the holding company. Investors in the USA might be reluctant to invest in India for reasons such as regulatory hurdles, foreign exchange implications and a general apprehension of investing in a foreign country. However, their attitudes may change while putting their money in a company incorporated in their country. Foreign domicile opens up the prospect of launching an IPO in the foreign country, thus making it easier to access the larger public capital market. Chances of merger or acquisition with foreign companies also increase. In addition, developed markets provide access to facilities such as incubators and advisors as a part of the wider business ecosystem. These factors contribute to the growth and success of a startup.  Companies with robust IP regimes prefer to transfer their IP abroad for better protection, control and valuation. Through a flip, the ownership of the IP is passed on to the foreign holding company which is protected by the IP laws of the foreign country. Additionally, jurisdictions with developed privacy and data security laws (such as EU) are lucrative destinations for startups looking for safer flow of data. Hence, there are sufficient compelling reasons for companies in India to flip to a foreign jurisdiction. The Old and the New ODI Regime A flip results in an investment made outside India in a holding company. This investment is then redirected to India in the Indian subsidiary of the holding company. There is a flow of investment in both directions. This is why a flip is often called a ‘round-trip structure’.  When investment is directed outwards, it triggers regulations on overseas direct investment (ODI). While an investment directed inward triggers regulations for foreign direct investment (FDI). For most cases, a foreign entity is free to invest in India. This is, however, subject to conditions such as entry routes, sectoral caps and pricing guidelines under the FDI policy. Restrictions on inward flow of investment is a discussion for another day. In the context of ODI, the old regime was marked with regulatory uncertainty and ambiguity. For instance, a key consideration for an Indian party to invest in a foreign entity is that the foreign entity should be engaged in a “bona fidebusiness activity”. In the old regime, there was no clarification on what constituted a bona fide business activity. This had led to unnecessary confusion and uncertainty in getting approvals from the RBI.  The new ODI regime defines “bona fide business activity” to mean any business activity permissible under any law in force in India and the host country. This definition is broad enough to include all businesses that are legal in India and the foreign country in question. In the earlier regime, flip structures were neither expressly prohibited nor permitted. In cases where there were ambiguities, companies were advised to seek prior approval from the RBI. The RBI, after considering the commercial nature of the activity, could grant or refuse permission to go ahead with the activity. The RBI had been of the view that flip structures were not bona fide business activities. As a result, it disallowed round-tripping. In an FAQ published by the RBI, it prohibited Indian entities from setting up an Indian subsidiary through an offshore company. The new regime has changed this position. It expressly permits an Indian entity to invest in a foreign entity which has a subsidiary in India. A significant restriction on such investments is that the overall structure should not result in more than two layers of subsidiaries. Welcoming the Change  The report of the High-Level Advisory Group chaired by Surjit S. Bhalla has made the observation that a blanket prohibition under the garb of ‘round-tripping’ of funds may affect legitimate business activities. The report also finds the apprehensions of RBI misplaced and is instead of the view that attracting foreign investment in India through the route of round-tripping structures would contribute to the growth of our economy. The new rules and regulations have made India’s ODI policy more liberal, predictable and easily comprehensible compared to the earlier regime. Certain compliance requirements have been reduced and general approvals through automatic route have been increased. It can be said that ambiguities still exist in relation to the definition of control, regulation for ODIs in foreign startups and the layers of subsidiary concept. However, the overall change brought by the new regime is a welcome move. Conclusion  India is one of the fastest-growing startup destinations. By permitting flip structures, the new ODI regime has opened up a huge opportunity for Indian startups to deepen investment by foreign portfolio investors and foreign nationals. Improved access to funding will ensure that innovative ideas are not nipped in the bud for the lack of investment. – Shubh Gautam Foreign Exchange Regulation Foreign Investment RBI"
